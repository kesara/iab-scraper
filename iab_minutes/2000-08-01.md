### NOTES:


#### 1. review actions

see above


#### 2. review drafts in progress

see above


#### 3. Themes & workshops for this year

Middle boxes


 (Jon Crowcroft presents; ftp://cs.ucl.ac.uk/darpa/mw.ppt.gz)  

The e-middle war–the end of the end-end principle?

 can we refine the architecture that says what goes in the middle?  

 what “we” like:
performance enhancements; soft state explicitly-addressable boxes
 what “we” don’t like:


 ALGs, “transparent proxies”; statefull NATs impedance mismatches abound  

 buffer cost vs. transmission –> cache  

 loss/delay/throughput –> snoop  

 private/public –> firewall  

 homogeneous vs. heterogeneous –> intranet vs. Internet
 is statefullness next to devil-worship?


 SMTP, etc. all work hop-by-hop…
 Who are “we”?  

 Dumb net, smart edge or vice-versa?  

 Real life


 replications of services for mirroring, demand-caching or transcoding, redirection for load balancing  

 need a router substrate to export more info, and an application level routing framework
 So…


 keep an eye on programmable networks and active services  

 eternal vigilance to point out middle war-e boxes that are pointless
 Constructive:


 have an IAB application level routing workshop?  

 write a draft on soft state  

 write a draft on optimization-type proxies (good)
 Destructive:


 more transparency/IPv6/anti-NAT drafts
Lots of IAB interest in this topic… Brian Carpenter will plan workshop in Spring ’01.


 Current list:


 Middle boxes  

 QoS and high availability  

 Integrity of infrastructure (availability):

 DNS and routing
 Another directory workshop?  

 International (charsets & identifiers)


 this is a hot topic; lots of interest in doing it asap

 (week of 9/11? 9/18?)  

 Korea? Japan?
New topics:


 instant messaging
#### 4. ICANN, PSO, IANA, etc.

Wide ranging discussions re. ongoing issues with ICANN, PSO, IANA, etc. were enjoyed by all.



### Future Meetings


Regular teleconference second Monday of the month at 10:00 AM Eastern Time.

II. Internet Leadership developments
ISOC is working with a group of experienced IETF participants to refine 
the IETF Technical Fellowship program. The goal is to improve the 
outcomes and impact of the program in terms of diversity of 
participation and leadership in the IETF.

ISOC is currently working with experienced IETF participants on the 
development of an IETF course suitable for universities.

III. Current and upcoming policy papers and/or surveys out for comment
Land-locked Developing Countries (LLDCs)
This report will focus on the unique challenges faced by LLDCs, and will

enable socio-economic development. A draft will be released at the end 
of July for feedback and the report will be finalised and released 
before the ITU World Telecommunication Development Conference in October 
2017.

Policy Brief: Spectrum Approaches to Community Networks 
The focus of this paper will be on the importance of enabling access to 
spectrum including utilisation of currently unused spectrum for 
community networks.  The paper is currently with ISOC's membership for

community networking community. We expect to release the brief in July.

Asia-Pacific Internet Policy Survey Report 2017
Now in its 4th installment, this year's APAC Internet Policy Survey aims 
to gain insights into Internet users' sentiments with regards to online 
regulation. It also takes an in-depth look at how they perceive and deal 
with personal information online, and the extent to which various 
entities are trusted to protect people's personal data and privacy 
rights. The report will be launched at APrIGF in July.

Accessibility Toolkit
Internet accessibility for people with disabilities is the focus of a 
new Internet Society project. The Accessibility Toolkit will include 
video interviews and personal stories that showcase the role that key 
international policies and programs play in removing barriers for people 
with disabilities. Please visit our webpage to learn more about the 
project: https://www.internetsociety.org/accessibility-toolkit

IANA Services Liaison Report – 12 July 2017
 
SLA Deliverables Update:
- ICANN met 100% of processing goal times for both the May 2017 and June 
2017 monthly statistics reports, exceeding the SLA goal to meet 90% of 
processing goal times.  These times include the steps that ICANN has 
control over and not time it is waiting on requesters, document authors 
or other experts.  
  
Other News:
  
- ICANN has posted the job description for the VP IANA Services/PTI 
President
 
- ICANN will be gathering feedback on user experience of IANA Services 
through focus groups and 1-on-1 meetings at the Prague IETF-99 meeting.  
The focus will be on how community members use the registries, request 
registrations, expert experience, Internet-Draft review process 
experience, etc.  The feedback will help contribute to the multi-year 
project underway to create a new registry workflow system.

#### 2.3. RFC Editor Liaison Report


##### 2.3.1. July


–Begin RFC Editor Liaison Report, Heather Flanagan–



```
RFC Series Editor Update

- Format
The tool that takes plain text RFCs and Internet Drafts and Converts txt
of RFCs and I-Ds into XML v2 files that are compatible with xml2rfc 
is actively being tested by the RFC Production Center (RPC). The next tool
in the chain, the xml2rfc v2 to v3 converter, has also been released
(see release notes for xml2rfc v2.7.0) and is ready for testing. The RFC
Series Editor will report on the progress, and request testers from the
community, at the upcoming Working Group Chairs lunch during IETF 99.

More information on the timeline for the various format tools is
available on the wiki:

https://trac.tools.ietf.org/tools/ietfdb/wiki/FormatToolsPlan

The evaluation of the existing RPC tool chain's ability to handle
non-ASCII characters is complete. Several areas of work were identified,
including changes to the database as well as updates to a variety of 
scripts. Two tools in particular, one that supports the conversion of 
nroff to txt and the second that supports the creation of PDF files, 
are under discussion. If the RPC is to publish RFCs with non-ASCII 
characters before the rest of the v3 environment is ready, then at the 
very least, the nroff to txt script will need to be modified (despite 
the fact it will be discarded after v3 is deployed). Discussions on 
how to handle creating a PDF are in progress. With 
draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc5987bis (one of the I-Ds used to test the
viability of non-ASCII characters in the existing tool chain) ready for
publication, and the precis documents now going through IETF Last Call,
there are compelling reasons to go ahead with the work on this script.
The RSOC is discussing the pros/cons of publishing RFCs with non-ASCII
characters now.


- IRTF and the publication of non-RFCs
The RSE will be meeting with the IRTF Chair, Allison Mankin, and the
ISE, Nevil Brownlee, during IETF 99 to discuss the possibilities and
requirements around experimenting with the publication of documents that
are explicitly not RFCs as a product of the IRTF.


RPC Update
- SLA
See: https://www.rfc-editor.org/report-summary/

The RPC met the SLA at Tier 2* in 2017Q2. “Tier 2*” indicates when Tier
2 is being applied in the “subsequent quarter”. See the reports page for
more detail on the different tiers.

From the report page notes:
Q2 2017: In response to requests on the rfc-interest list, stable and 
“pretty” URLs are now available for RFC errata entries. They appear as 
<https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eidXXX>. This means that errata 
references can contain a URL for a specific erratum. The RFC Style 
Guide will be updated to incorporate the new URLs.
```

```
RFC Series Editor Update

- Format
During IETF 99, the RSE, RPC staff, and Henrik Levkowetz had time to
discuss whether or not the initially proposed order for tool production
made sense given what we've learned since coding started. One minor
change was made to the list, with the publication formatter for text
moving up in the list so that the RPC could start testing the v2 to v3
converter. (Currently, while we have a v2 to v3 converter, the tools
have not been developed to actually test the v3 output.)

For an update on the planning timeline, see:

https://trac.tools.ietf.org/tools/ietfdb/wiki/FormatToolsPlan

In addition to meetings around tool development, the RSE presented an
update regarding the format project at the WG Chairs lunch. The
recording and slides from that session will be available in the IEF 99
Meeting Materials page.

- IRTF and the publication of non-RFCs
The RSE met with the IRTF Chair, Allison Mankin during IETF 99 to
discuss the possibilities and requirements around experimenting with the
publication of documents that are explicitly not RFCs as a product of
the IRTF. Also at the meeting were Nevil Brownlee (ISE), Sandy Ginoza
(RFC Production Center), and Alice Russo (RFC Production Center). The
conversation focused on if and how the IRTF might produce an Open Access
journal. Further discussions are required before the RSE and RPC can
determine if this model would use the RFC Editor as a publisher, be
completely external to the RFC Editor, or something in between.

- Computer History Museum and RFC Digital Preservation
The RFC Editor and the IETF Trust are waiting for a review of the
proposed final text to the Memorandum of Understanding required by the
CHM for ingesting and archiving copies of RFCs. As soon as the CHM
lawyers have completed their review, the IETF Trust has authorized Kaveh
Ranjbar (IETF Trust chair) to sign the MoU.


RPC Update
- SLA
See: https://www.rfc-editor.org/report-summary/

The RPC met the SLA at Tier 2* in 2017Q2. “Tier 2*” indicates when Tier
2 is being applied in the “subsequent quarter”. See the reports page for
more detail on the different tiers.

From the report page notes:
Q2 2017: In response to requests on the rfc-interest list, stable and
“pretty” URLs are now available for RFC errata entries. They appear as
<https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eidXXX>. This means that errata

### NOTES:


#### 1. review actions

see above


#### 2. review drafts in progress

see above


#### 3. administrivia

Move calls two hours later?


#### 4. IRTF news


#### 5. IESG liaison report

The IESG is (once again) discussing updating format of RFCs. Looks like a good time to pursue. Henning Schulzrinne has distributed draft proposal that looks like a good starting point. Concern expressed re. stability of any format beyond ASCII.


 General agreement to modify the RFC Editor’s “Statement of Work” to ask the RFC Editor to run an experiment with XML DTD to nroff translation for RFC publication formatting/editing. ISOC appears agreeable to modest additional funding to support this experiment, provided ISI would project manage it. 


 One specific request is that when RFCs become obsolete, the forward and backward references in rfc-index.txt should be updated. 


#### 6. Other liaisons and external issues

3GPP: Would like to negotiate formal arrangement with “joint development” provisions. Going through many cycles, but so far we and they are not on the same page re. joint development. Thomas Narten and John Klensin will be attending 3GPP technical meeting in Hawaii in next few weeks. Meanwhile, ANSI’s Board of Directors took the unusual step of creating a competing body (“3GPP2”) because of concerns that 3GPP may not be open enough.


 E164.ARPA: Things looking up… 


 PSO nomination: PSO-PC is managing to have a dialog about the candidates; looking hopeful for a consensus decision based on candidate qualifications.
 


#### 7. Internationalization workshop status

Will not happen in September. Now aiming for October/November.


#### 8. Middlebox workshop status

Brian Carpenter not on call.

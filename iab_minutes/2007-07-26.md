### 2. ICCRG Review


Wesley M. Eddy presented an overview of the ICCRG.


### 3. T-MPLS Issues


The ITUâ€™s T-MPLS protocol as specified by the ITU makes use of several codepoints assigned to the IETF in a way that presents a risk of failure to interoperate. The ITU has been made aware of this issue at various levels, but the problem persists.


Extensive discussion took place regarding what organisational response might be appropriate in order to escalate the issue, with a goal of achieving resolution of the problem.


It was agreed that efforts should be made between the IAB and IESG to draft a formal communication to appropriate ITU leadership.


### 4. Cablelabs Liaison Selection


The selection of a Cablelabs liaison was deferred due to lack of time.

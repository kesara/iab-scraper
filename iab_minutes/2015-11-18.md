I. Internet Society 2016 Action Plan
The Internet Society 2016 Action Plan was approved by the Board of 
Trustees at their recent meeting in Yokohama, Japan. ISOC CEO Kathy 
Brown wrote about the plan (<https://www.internetsociety.org/blog/ 
institutional/2015/11/announcing-internet-society-2016-action-plan>) and 
the document itself is also available (<https://www.internetsociety.org/ 
doc/internet-society-2016-action-plan>).

II. IETF Policy Program @ IETF 94
The IETF 94 Policy Program group of policy makers was keenly engaged and 
interested in the work of the IETF and of ISOC. They each took away 
ideas and possible actions for how to advance key Internet priorities in 
their countries ranging from IPv6 to CSIRTs to IETF engagement. They 
were impressed that the IETF has such committed experts and were 
interested in opportunities to leverage this network in future. There 
was keen interest from delegates from the Pacific Islands and Bhutan in 
IPv6 deployment. They had some great suggestions for ways to improve the 
program that will be implemented at future meetings.

III. IANA and ICANN accountability
On November 15, the CCWG released a very high-level summary of the main 
changes being proposed by the community and outlined what will be 
described in the full proposal. This 36-page document is designed to 
update the community on recent progress made during and since the 
ICANN54 meeting in Dublin and to raise awareness of the proposed 
enhancements to ICANN's accountability while the more detailed proposal 
is finalized. While this formal update reflects the current consensus 
position of the group, there are outstanding elements that remain to be 
finalized. The full Third Draft Proposal on Work Stream 1 
Recommendations will be shared with the public on 30 November 2015 and 
will include further explanation and detail about the accountability 
improvements outlined in the summary document. It will also explain why 
the changes have been suggested, how the community arrived at these 
recommendations and the options considered and ultimately rejected in 
the course of the development of the final proposal.

With regards to ICANN’s role vis-a-vis the protocol parameters, the text 
was adjusted and now states:
"4. Collaborates with other bodies as appropriate to publish core 
registries needed for the functioning of the Internet. In this role, 
with respect to protocol ports and parameters, ICANN's Mission is to 
provide registration services and open access for registries in the 
public domain requested by Internet protocol development organizations, 
such as the Internet Engineering Task Force."

IV. Capacity building
In Nicaragua, ISOC has donated a switch and staff have provided training 
and support to technical experts in Managua to help develop an IXP and 
strengthen local technical capacity. In the Philippines, ISOC staff 
participated in an IXP development and capacity building workshop at the 
invitation of the Filipino government. At the request of the Nigerian 
IXP (IXPN), ISOC is sending local African trainers to Abuja to provide 
network training to improve BGP and related training. Online moderated 
network training was conducted with over 25 engineers in Lesotho using a 
new AfNOG training course. ISOC African regional bureau staff moderated 
this training which to date has trained over four times the number of 
participants in previous face-to-face workshops.

V. African Route Collection and Analysis
ISOC has begun work with IMDEA to support a route collection and 
analysis project to augment existing measurement analyses, strengthen 
African IXPs, and to support RIPE Atlas probe and anchor deployment.  
Servers have been purchased for this project in Ghana, DRC, Lesotho, and 
South Africa.

VI. IGF 2015
The Internet Society was one of the main representatives of the 
technical community at the 10th Internet Governance Forum from 9-13 
November in João Pessoa, Brazil. Internet Society staff and board 
members participated in a wide range of workshops, best practice forums 
and other sessions.  Full coverage of ISOC activity at IGF 2015 can be 
found at <https://www.internetsociety.org/igf2015>.

ISOC CEO, Kathy Brown, wrote about IGF2015 and the future for IGF 
(<http://www.internetsociety.org/blog/public-policy/2015/11/looking- 
beyond-igf-2015-wsis10>), including a call for individuals and 
organisations to support a statement conveying three key messages to 
contribute to negotiations in the final phase of the World Summit on the 
Information Society 10-year review process (WSIS+10) 
(<https://www.openwsis2015.org/joint-statement-on-wsis10/>).

VII. Internet Policy Briefs
In an ongoing effort to make Internet policy issues easier to 
understand, on 2 Nov, the Internet Society published an initial set of 
ten "policy briefs" on topics such as network neutrality, IXPs, botnets, 
privacy, human rights and open Internet standards. More documents will 
be added in the months ahead. They can be viewed and downloaded at 
<https://www.internetsociety.org/policybriefs/>.

VIII. DNSSEC Workshop at ICANN54
The DNSSEC workshop at ICANN54 in Dublin had a packed agenda including 
discussion of DNSSEC deployment in Europe, DNSSEC signing at scale, 
barriers to deployment and multiple demonstrations of DANE usage with 
email. Recordings, slides and more information can be found at <https:// 
meetings.icann.org/en/dublin54/schedule/wed-dnssec>.

IX. MANRS
The Mutually Assured Norms for Routing Security (MANRS) initiative 
recently passed its first year of operation and also added its first 
Japanese network operator <https://www.routingmanifesto.org/2015/11/ 
manrs-turns-1-and-first-japanese-operator-iij-joins/>.

X. Tech Fellows @ IETF 94
The Tech Fellows Program at IETF 94 was a great success and brought 
together 14 individuals from 8 countries. A number of past Fellows have 
been involved in the development of RFCs, and continue to build 
awareness in their respective communities on the importance of the work 
of the IETF. The Tech Fellows were tightly integrated with the Public 
Policy guests in a number of sessions and this allowed for dynamic 
exchanges and cross pollination between the two programs. Many of the 
fellows also participated in the 'IETF in LAC' meeting to prepare for 
IETF 95 in Buenos Aires and to help galvanize the broader technical 
community in Latin America. Lessons learned in this process are being 
shared with the African technical community.

–End IRTF Chair Report, Lars Eggert–


Ted Hardie noted that the charter for the Proposed Human Rights Protocol Considerations Research Group is currently under review, and asked the IAB to review that.


#### 2.4. IANA Liaison Report


–Begin IANA Liaison Report, Michelle Cotton–



```
IANA Liaison Report – 18 November 2015

Proposed 2015 SLA Deliverables Update:

- ICANN met 89% of processing goal times for the September 2015 monthly 
statistics.  This was the first time in many years SLA goal was not 
reached.  A large group of 15 requests were 1 day late of the goal 
causing the drop in the percentage.  ICANN met 99% of processing goal 
times for the October 2015 monthly statistic exceeding the SLA goal to 
meet 90% of processing goal times.  These times include the steps that 
the IANA Department has control over and not time it is waiting on 
requesters, document authors or other experts.

- Third-party review of the protocol parameter processing is almost 
complete.  A report will be delivered to the IPROC by the end of March 
2016 as directed by the SLA.

Other News:

- Staffing update: We have hired an IANA Specialist.  We now have 1 open 
position in the IANA Department.

#### 2.5. RFC Editor Liaison Report


–Begin RFC Editor Liaison Report, Heather Flanagan–



```
RSE Update
* Format project
The RSOC has completed their review the RFC format drafts. Minor updates 
are being made based on the feedback received during this review period. 
The drafts will be sent on the IAB shortly with a request to consider 
them as IAB stream documents and to start the IAB publication process.

* W3C TPAC
The RSE attended the Digital Publishing Interest Group meeting as part 
of the W3C TPAC in Sapporo the week before IETF 94. Meeting summaries 
for the two-day meeting are available online:
- - Day 1: https://www.w3.org/blog/dpub/2015/11/02/tpac-summary-dpub-
f2f-day-1-overview-anno-epub-3-1-css-pom-serviceworkers/
- - Day 2: https://www.w3.org/blog/dpub/2015/11/02/tpac-summary-day-2-
ed-outreach-ids-aria/


RPC
* The SLA was not met for October 2015. See the stats and reports here:

> [Reports](https://www.rfc-editor.org/report-summary/)


The RPC did not meet the SLA this month. From the report notes:
*October 2015*: The RPC released the new RFC Editor website 
<https://www.rfc-editor.org> and monitored feedback. In the latter half 
of the month, staff prepared for IETF 94 in Yokohama, Japan.
*September & October 2015*: As seen in the graph, there was an second 
influx of document submissions and documents moved to EDIT. The first 
surge started in January (just prior to IETF 92); the second surge 
started in September (just before IETF 94).
*October 2015:* As noted above, there was a large burst in document 
submissions in September and October, which results in a larger overall 
queue size.

* IETF 94
IETF 94 was a fairly quiet meeting for the RFC Editor. As usual, the RFC 
Editor desk saw a steady stream of visitors. The Sunday Tools for 
Creating I-Ds tutorial, which included a presentation by Alice Russo, 
saw about 20 attendees. Questions were asked regarding better 
collaboration tools for creating I-Ds; the availability of supported 
author tools remain a significant area of concern for the community.

Heather Flanagan noted that the RFC format drafts would be headed to the IAB for review in the next week or so.


### 3. Public IAB Mailing Lists


After a brief discussion, the IAB agreed to add a page to the website listing all of the open IAB mailing lists. Additionally, the IAB will send notices to IETF-Announce about new open IAB mailing lists. Cindy Morgan will update the website, and work with Suzanne Woolf to coordinate the announcement of the inip-discuss list.


### 4. Strint-attendees archives


The report from the STRINT workshop (currently in AUTH48) has a reference to the strint-attendees archives, which are currently hosted on i1b.org. i1b.org does not currently support accessing those archives over HTTPS, and since the IAB had previously agreed to host all open IAB mailing lists on iab.org (rather than i1b.org), the IAB agreed to move those archives to iab.org.


Marc Blanchet noted that the authors of the workshop report are currently discussing removing that reference from the document, but the IAB agreed that the archives should be moved in any case.


Cindy Morgan noted that the mailing list has recently been hit with more spam than normal (all caught in moderation), and asked if that mailing list still needed to be open, since the workshop is over. Cindy Morgan will check with Stephen Farrell before closing the mailing list.


### 5. IOT Semantic Interoperability Workshop


Dave Thaler reported that the program committee for the IOT Semantic Interoperability Workshop has been looking for a company to host the workshop in Silicon Valley in spring 2016.


One of the workshop’s goals will be to get the people from the disparate organizations working in this space together and share information, facilitating future interactions. Potential participants include both people from academia, and those representing organizations working on IOT schemas. The program committee is also considering allowing remote participation functionality for those representing organizations working on IOT schemas who would not otherwise participate.


Dave Thaler asked that this topic be kept on the agenda for the next IAB meeting to follow up on the dates and host details.


### 6. ICANN TLG Appointment


Cindy Morgan will draft a timeline for the IAB’s appointment to the ICANN Technical Liaison Group. Russ Housley will shepherd the process from the IAB side.


### 7. ISOC Board of Trustees Appointment


Cindy Morgan will draft a timeline for the IAB’s appointment to the ISOC Board of Trustees. Ted Hardie will shepherd the process from the IAB side.


Mat Ford reported that ISOC plans to make their announcement by Monday, 9 May 2016, so it would be ideal to have the IAB candidate confirmed by Friday, 6 May 2016.


### 8. Tech Topic at IETF 95


Noting the feedback from the combined IAB/IESG/IAOC plenary at IETF 94, the IAB discussed how to handle the technical topic for IETF 95. With the additional time required for budget reporting and leadership turnover necessary for the March IETF meeting, there is less time available during the plenary for a technical topic. The IAB is considering other avenues, e.g., a lunchtime session, or an IAB breakout session.


Andrew Sullivan asked the IAB to come up with potential technical topics and discuss again at the next IAB teleconference.


### 9. Draft Category A Liaison Agreement for ISO/TC204 and IETF


The IAB approved the Draft Category A Liaison Agreement between ISO/TC204 and the IETF. Russ Housley will sign the agreement on behalf of the IAB.


### 10. draft-iab-rfc5741bis


Dave Thaler asked to have until the end of the day to finish his review of draft-iab-rfc5741bis. The IAB agreed to send draft-iab-rfc5741bis out for IETF community review pending the completion of Dave’s review and a new revision to address comments from Marc Blanchet. Robert Sparks will let Cindy Morgan know when the new version has been uploaded so that the review message can be sent.


### 11. Program Mechanics


The discussion on Program mechanics was deferred until the next meeting on 25 November 2015.


### 12. Executive Session: IGF


The recent IGF was discussed in an executive session.


Andrew Sullivan will start an e-vote on whether the IAB should sign the Joint Statement on WSIS+10.

### 5. WCIT Session at IETF 86


The board agreed to propose a session relating to WCIT at IETF 86. Joel Halpern and Ross Callon will file the request prior to the deadline on 28 January 2013, requesting a one hour session.


### 6. ITU-T Coordination Update


Eliot Lear recommended that the IAB not participate in the ITU-T strategic review committee, due to the asymmetry of its terms of reference, and suggested consulting with peer organizations on ways to move forward. The IAB agreed with this recommendation.


Now that WTSA and WCIT are over, Eliot recommends revising the membership of the itu-t-program mailing list and phasing out the itu-t-liaisons mailing list in order to eliminate confusion and streamline strategic discussions. The IAB agreed with this  

recommendation and made plans to proceed accordingly.


Eliot noted that there is some overlap between the IAB and ISOC charters as they relate to external relationships. Bernard Aboba, Jari Arkko, Ross Callon, Spencer Dawkins, Joel Halpern and Hannes Tschofenig agreed to look at the current collaboration with ISOC and to develop recommendations for the IAB.


### 7. IEEE 802/IETF Coordination Update


Dan Romascanu updated the board about the ongoing coordination with IEEE 802. The team working on the revision to RFC 4441 hopes to have the document ready for IAB last call and IEEE 802 EC review by IETF 86 in Orlando. Several coordinated activities are planned at IETF 86, including a tutorial on the 802.1 architecture, a presentation on MAC address OUI restructuring and virtualization at the Technical Plenary, and a face-to-face meeting between the IESG/IAB and IEEE 802 leadership on Saturday, March 16, 2013.


### 8. IETF 86 Agenda

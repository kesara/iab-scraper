### 2. Routing Research Group (RRG) Review


At this tech chat Lixia led a technical discussion and review of  

recent work in the RRG. The RRG has been quite active over the  

last year exploring architectural approaches to addressing the  

challenges facing Internet inter-domain routing. There are several  

(partly) overlapping problems in this space, including host and  

site multihoming, traffic engineering, and support for mobility.  

The proposals so far can be roughly divided into the two classes  

of “separation” and “elimination” of non-aggregatable addresses  

in the global routing table (i.e., Default-Free Zone). There was  

significant IAB interest in the topic and further discussion was  

planned for an upcoming IAB meeting.

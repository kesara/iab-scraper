### NOTES


0. #### Roll call, Agenda Bash and Previous Minutes


	 Minutes of the [8 June teleconference](/documents/minutes/minutes-2004/iab-minutes-2004-06-08/) were approved.
1. #### Review of Action Items


	([see below](#actions))
2. #### Review of Documents


	 ([see below](#documents))
3. ####  IAB Liaison Reports


	 **IESG**  
	
	*Rob Austein:*, *Bert Wijnen*: 
	
	
		+ RFC3667 and RFC3668 have some minor issues. Work has commenced to rectify these issues, and publish this as new RFCs as soon as possible.
		+ New I-Ds are now required to have new RFC3668 boiler plate, as per announcement:  
		
		<http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/ietf-announce/current/msg00244.html>
		
		
		
		 Unfortunately this is resulting in some I-Ds not being accepted, and in some cases a clear explanation of the reasons for this action is not being provided to the submitter.
		
		
			 *[Note: This procedure was amended to be effective post IETF60]*
		+ Mail handling for most IETF hosted mailing lists (including IESG list) is currently experiencing a high delay in redistribution to the list. IESG is monitoring (Bill Fenner) and alerting secretariat about the situation. Some configuration problems have been located and corrected, and further work is underway to implement a mail support configuration which should not experience these delays. The implementation schedule is not yet firm, but should be known soon.**RFC Editor**  
	
	*Joyce Reynolds:* 
	
	
		+ No items to report. **IRTF**  
	
	*Vern Paxson:* 
	
	
		+ The Host Identity Protocol Research Group has been chartered.
		+ The chair of the Anti-Spam Research Group (John Levine) will give an overview presentation at the San Diego IETF meeting plenary. **ISOC**  
	
	 *Lynn St Amour:* 
	
	
		+ No items to report.**Administrative Restructuring**  
	 *Leslie Daigle:* 
	
	
		+ No items to report.
4. #### Updates from IETF Liaisons


	**ITU-T**  
	
	*Scott Bradner:*
	
	
		+ No items to report.**W3C**  
	
	*Leslie Daigle:* 
	
	
		+ No items to report. **ICANN – TLG**  
	
	*Geoff Huston*, *Rob Austein:* 
	
	
		+ No items to report **ICANN – Liaison to the Board**  
	
	*John Klensin:*
	
	
		+ No items to report.**RSSAC**  
	
	*Rob Austein:*
	
	
		+ IANA delegation procedure for IPv6 “glue” RRs in the root zone has been announced. IANA is now looking at the queue of requests for IPv6 glue from TLD managers; barring last minute surprises, first insertion of AAAA RRs into the root zone is expected to occur in the very near future. **IEEE 802**  
	
	*Bernard Aboba:*
	
	
		+ The IETF has now completed all documents requested by IEEE 802, with a single exception. A revision of this document is anticipated to address IETF review comments.
		+ IEEE 802 has been considering how to address the task of standardization of network selection. It is noted that there have been submissions to the IETF on this topic, and IEEE 802 will be sending a liaison note to the IETF concerning a proposed approach of coordination between IEEE 802 and the IETF on standardization of this function.
		+ A [detailed liaison report](/liaisons/ieee/2004-07-liaison-report/) has been filed with the IAB.
5. #### ITU Responses concerning ENUM Instructions



> 
>  The IAB considered recent ITU-T SG2 liaison statements of May 2004 [[Stmt-1](http://www.ietf.org/IESG/LIAISON/file12.pdf),  
> 
> [Stmt-2](http://www.ietf.org/IESG/LIAISON/file15.pdf)] concerning ENUM, and endorsed responses to the outstanding matters such that the IPR statements are filed with the IETF, the current operational management procedures are reaffirmed, and that clarifications regarding instructions to the RIPE NCC are issued in accordance with these procedures.
> 
> 
>
6. #### Proposed IPv6 allocation ad hoc IAB advisory committee



> 
>  The IAB agreed to the formation of an ad hoc IAB advisory committee to develop advice to the IAB on matters relating to IPv6.
> 
> 
>
7. #### IETF 60 Arrangements



> 
>  The IAB finalized its agenda for IETF 60. Technical topics to be examined are:
> 
> 
> 
> 	* Identity and IPv6 and Multi6
> 	* Untangling ALGs, NATs Firewalls, IPv6 transition mechanisms and Application behaviors
>  The Thursday IAB session will include:
> 
> 
> 
> 	* IRTF RG review
> 	* IAB Security Workshop Revisited
>
8. #### Liaison Reporting to the IAB



> 
>  The IAB endorsed adoption of a procedure that will enable all IETF liaisons to report regularly to the IESG and IAB on matters of relevance to the liaison arrangements.
> 
> 
>
9. #### Other Regular Business



> 
> 
> 	1. #### SECSAC Report
> 	
> 	
> 	
> 	>

> 	> 
> 	> 
> 	>  The IAB determined that there were no actions arising from this report at this point in time.
> 	> 
> 	> 
> 	> 
> 	>
> 	2. #### IANA Reverse Delegation
> 	
> 	
> 	
> 	> 
> 	>  A reminder will be forwarded to the IANA concerning outstanding delegation requests for ip6.arpa
> 	> 
> 	> 
> 	> 
> 	>
> 	3. #### IPv6 ULA drafts
> 	
> 	
> 	
> 	> 
> 	>  The IAB considered the implications of the UIPv6 ULA drafts, and requested a group to brief the IAB in terms of the operational and architectural aspects of deployment of this form of address space.
> 	> 
> 	> 
> 	>
> 	4. #### Open Source implementations of \*RP functionality
> 	
> 	
> 	
> 	> 
> 	>  The IAB proposed to investigate whether there was a process failure in this matter, on the basis that the open source community response to the IAB’s query included the claim that their attempts to obtain a protocol number through the process resulted in no response.
> 	> 
> 	> 
> 	> 
> 	> 
> 	>  The IAB will follow up with the IANA and the IESG over the process used and actions taken with the processing of the application for registration of port numbers

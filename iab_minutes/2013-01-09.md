### 2. Tech Chat: Empirical Studies of Bottom-up Internet Governance


Jesse Sowell led the board in a discussion on bottom-up organizational modes of internet governance at the intersection of Internet operations and security, focusing on data from network operator groups (NOGs) and RIRs, Internet eXchange Points (IXPs), and anti-abuse organizations such as the Messaging Anti-Abuse Working Group (MAAWG).


It was noted that in many cases, the governance models consist of actors pushing private interests while producing work with public benefits. Outstanding questions include:


* Where does the authority of these organizations come from, and what is the scope?
* Does this authority undermine or complement state-based authority, despite being independent of it?

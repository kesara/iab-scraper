### NOTES


1. ####  RSSAC Liaison Report



**RSSAC**  

*Rob Austein:*



	1. There is some level of interest within this forum for undertaking some activity in the IETF relating to the server- id concept. This is being investigated with the relevant IETF Working Group chair.
	2. Some server operators have deployed IPv4 anycast as part of their deployment. The RSSAC has commenced investigation with the IPv6 equivalent, and have noted some differences in the IPv6 anycast specification. There is a request via this liaison to the IETF for some clarification in this aspect of the IPv6 specification. The liaison will followup on this action.
	3. It has been noted that there is a schedule clash with IETF 59 and the next ICANN meeting, and any scheduling ability to reduce the impact on this for RSSAC members who are active in relevant DNS WGs would be appreciated.
2. #### Review of IAB Advisory Committee Report
[Sunday, 9th November]



> 
> The IAB, in a joint session with the IESG, reviewed a draft of the IAB Advisory Committee Report.
> 
> 
> The IAB accepted the Advisory Committee’s advice regarding a review of the Committee’s report by the IETF community, and the report’s findings were presented at the IETF 58 Plenary.
> 
> 
> The IAB and IESG agreed to the following steps:
> 
> 
> 
> > 
> > 
> > 	1. The IETF and IAB chairs to work from the Advisory Committee’s report and develop a proposed set of actions, in conjunction with a small team.
> > 	2. The IETF and IAB chairs to present proposals to the IAB and IESG.
> > 	3. The IAB and IESG to determine an overall direction from among the proposals.
> > 	4. Presentation of direction to the IETF, including any requests for ratification through a rough consensus process when appropriate
> > 
> 
> 
> The IAB chair will publish the IAB Advisory Committee’s final report as an IAB Internet Draft.
> 
>
3. #### Consideration of IPv6 Site Local Appeal
[Tuesday, 11th November]



> 
> The IAB met in restricted session (Voting Members of the IAB) and considered a draft response to the IPv6 site-local address appeal.
> 
> 
> The IAB agreed to respond to the appellant prior to the IETF 58 Plenary and include the IAB response to the appeal in the Plenary agenda.
> 
> 
> The IAB response is archived at: [http://www.iab.org/appeals/2003-11-tlh-ipv6-site-local-response.html](/appeals/2003-2/iab-response-to-appeal-against-iesg-action-raised-by-mr-t-hain-appeal-text-november-2003/).
> 
> 
>
4. #### Liaison to Global Grid Forum [Tuesday, 11th November]



> 
> The IAB nominated Brian Carpenter as the IETF’s liaison to the Global Grid Forum. Brian was requested to provide the IAB with a list of work items that require some level of IETF attention from the perspective of the GGF.
> 
> 
>
5. #### Review of Architectural Implications arising from Network Abuse [Tuesday, 11th November]



> 
> The IAB considered a number of reports concerning the rising levels of network abuse, including trends in volumes of spam, trends in email-carried virus activity and direct attack via worms.
> 
> 
> It was noted that the rise in spam levels is such that it is now at a point of overwhelming genuine mail traffic, while various forms of direct attack of end systems continues without any noteable abatement.
> 
> 
> The IAB considered that security implications may result from these trends, and what form of mediation in the form of active middleware may be required to assist end users to negotiate a transaction across a potentially hostile and noise-prone network.
> 
> 
>
6. #### Review of Identifiers and End-to-End Considerations [Tuesday, 11th November]



> 
> The IAB reviewed the current progress in IAB drafts on futures of end-to-end and on Internet Identities. [[Presentation]](/wp-content/IAB-uploads/2011/03/2003-11-11-identities.pdf)
> 
> 
>
7. #### Review of IRTF Anti-Spam Research Group
[Thursday, 13th November]



> 
> The IAB was joined by Dave Crocker, Yakov Shafranovich, John Levine and Alan DeKok from the ASRG.
> 
> 
> The intent of this session was to provide some perspectives as to any outcomes from the ASRG effort that the IETF could be doing at this point in time.
> 
> 
> It was noted that there was no single solution to this problem, and that measures in a number of areas, including legal, social and technical were underway. It was also noted that many of the measures may mitigate the problem, but complete removal through detection and eradication was not a current realistic outcome. It was also noted that any approach considered by the IETF would be applied in conjunction with other approaches. It was also noted that spam is an adaptive behaviour, and the salient question when considering approaches is not necessarily focussed on what would happen today if the proposed technology were deployed, but what is likely to happen in response to deployment. It was also noted that there are a diverse collection of different email constituencies and something that may work in one context may be devastating in another. For example challenge-response mail delivery systems is not applicable for all. The problems in coming up with technical solutions is the different communities and the diverse way in which people communicate.
> 
> 
> The “Reverse MX” approach is one potential approach that could be used in combination with other measures to reduce the overall problem, although it is noted that it relies on large scale adoption in order to be effective. Other technology approaches require further architectural judgement. It was noted that there appeared to be no clear view in the ASRG as to when an approach is considered to be ‘ready’ for the IETF. Some individual approaches have been tested in implementations, but systematic data collection using these approaches has not been undertaken.
> 
> 
> It was also noted that taking things into the IETF has high overhead and effort. The intended approach in the RG is that if the proposal has been well-documented, no obvious flaws, has some implementations, then the basic approach is to then pass this to the IETF for consideration.
> 
> 
>

### Attachment A


### Open Architecture Discussion Topic:



> 
> ### Are Insecurities at the Edge the Biggest Challenge Yet to the End-to-End Model of the Internet?
> 
> 
> When we think of DDOS and Internet-propagated virii, we typically focus on the bad behaviour of the instigator. And, as recent years have seen a massive increase in the amount of malicious and/or unsolicited traffic on the Internet — denial of service attacks, worms, virii, spam — we are painfully aware of the costs. Not only end-users are impacted, in the case of spam: anyone setting up mail service has to provision it to handle the amount of traffic it will get, not just the amount of legitimate traffic.
> 
> 
> Looking at the rate of increase of these attacks — e.g., the spike in spam after the SoBig virus was detected — it seems that the viral nature of propagation has its own set of implications: not only must we deploy countermeasures within the network to avoid the flattening of endpoints under attack, it is increasingly obvious that “endpoints” as we know them cannot be trusted.
> 
> 
> If endpoints cannot be trusted, then the proposed longer term solutions for spam that are based on authenticating senders via credentials will not succeed as the only solution. Imagine if you will a situation where if present trends continue we might project seeing things such as the following:
> 
> 
> 1. Continuous DDOS attacks against the Internet infrastructure.
> 2. Releases of multiple CERT advisories **every day**.
> 3. Virus traffic + spam + patches + file “sharing” traffic comprising the overwhelming fraction of total Internet bandwidth.
> 4. Organizations restricting or actually **decommissioning** use of email.
> 
> 
> The combination of all these trends makes the threat to the end-to-end model from NAT or filtering look fairly minor.
> 
> 
> This discussion will include brief presentations outlining some metrics used to determine the trendlines and attempt to determine the current scope of the problem and the slope of the trend line.
> 
> 
> The important points for further discussion are:
> 
> 
> 1. what are some of the additional implications, in terms of work the IETF could and should be doing?
> 2. since the data shows that a substantial amount of malicious traffic (worms, ddos, virus propagation) is virally generated and operating with the full rights and priviledges of some real user, to what extent is conventional authentication & authorization technology useful?
> 
> 
> This is meant to be an interactive discussion amongst all the engineers and architects in the plenary; please come prepared to share thoughts and pointers.
> 
>

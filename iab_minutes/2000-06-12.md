### NOTES:


#### 1. Minutes of previous meeting


#### 2. Review of action items

see above


#### 3. Administrivia

Face-face meeting at IETF: Tuesday evening, opposite social.


#### 4. IRTF report and news


#### 5. IESG liaison report and news

Issue of IESG review of IRTF (and IAB) documents still open… include in breakfast chat at next IETF.


#### 6. Other outstanding liaison and similar issues

PSO/PC needs to provide nominations committee members for independent review panel for ICANN. ITU/ETSI have already named one member; W3C/IETF need to name another.


 IETF also has opportunity to propose names (probably one) for ICANN Board; call for nominees next week, closure a month later. We (IAB/IETF) have not resolved how we are going to do this in open fashion consistent with our usual processes; one possibility is the IETF NomComm. If NomComm says “no”, then probably the IAB can step up. 


 Will be PSO general meeting at IETF in Pittsburgh. 


#### 7. .ARPA status


 ICANN mess  

Procedures to use with “other SDOs”

#### 8. Appeals, pending appeals, and boilerplate


#### 9. Task list sorting

Themes: Integrity of infrastructure:


 DNS and routing  

 International (charsets & identifiers)
 Need more discussion on mailing list. More depth at face-face in Pittsburgh.
 



### Future Meetings

### 2. Tech Chat: Global Access to the Internet for All (GAIA)


Jane Coffin and Arjuna Sathiaseelan joined the IAB to talk about some of the technical and architectural issues around GAIA.


Arjuna Sathiaseelan noted that the GAIA Research Group was chartered in 2014, and has over 400 members. Their goal is to bring together the practitioners, researchers, corporations, non governmental and governmental organizations that are working on the challenges in enabling global Internet access.


Lee Howard asked what the definition of a “community network” is. Jane Coffin replied that it is a community-run, community-built, and community-led network. It can mesh fiber, wifi, and TV white space spectrums. Community networks are organized by local people in collaboration and may not use the same access technologies that commercial networks do. They are not meant to complete with things like GSM, but to be complementary, bottom-up solutions.


Jane Coffin reported that GAIA’s outreach has included has worked with RIPE NCC to deploy their Atlas probes. They are also looking at routing patterns trace routes, and how traffic has increased in certain countries. There is some interest from the University of Washington on an open cellular solution for 2G networks in developing nations.


Brian Trammell noted that there are a lot of potentially interesting plenary talks that could come out of GAIA, and asked if there are people in the community who would make good speakers. Jane Coffin replied that there are several spectrum experts, and Arjuna Sathiaseelan added that they have people looking at the measurement of traditional access in Africa and how it can be optimized in different ways.

Online Trust Alliance Email Marketing Best Practices & Unsubscribe 
Report
The Online Trust Alliance's fourth annual Email Marketing Best Practices 
& Unsubscribe Report was released (press release [1], report [2]). The 
report looks at the overall trust associated with retailer email – can 
you trust who it’s from (email authentication), and can you trust 
they’ll honor your wishes (email marketing and unsubscribe practices)? 
The OTA will hold a webinar on Wednesday, December 13 at 1 p.m. EST. to 
review findings from the report. Register [3].

Expert Group Meeting: Understanding the potential of Blockchain 
technology in Africa, 21 November 2017, UNECA, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia 
United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), organized an 
expert group meeting on “Understanding the potential of blockchain 
technology in Africa”. The objective of the meeting was to assess the 
broad concepts, knowledge and practices of blockchain technologies in 
the context of their application in Africa through the provision of use 
case studies in the continent and to provide policy orientation for 
consideration by African policy and decision-makers. ISOC was 
represented on a panel to discuss the risks and opportunities of 
blockchain, distributed ledger and cryptocurrency technologies for 
Africa. Governments and Telcos are worried about how to regulate the 
resulting innovation; civil society expressed concerns about the 
environmental impact of cryptocurrency ”mining”, and the economic 
imbalance in favour of societies in which computing and energy resources 
are cheap. UNECA invited ISOC to send a copy of the forthcoming report 
on “Blockhain and Identity” for distribution to the participants. More 
information: https://www.uneca.org/egm-upbta-2017

Blogpost on Net Neutrality
ISOC's Regional Bureau Director for North America published a post 
related to the FCC's statement about their action to rollback their 
network neutrality order: https://www.internetsociety.org/blog/2017/11/
need-sustainable-approach-network-neutrality/
Key takeaways from this post:
1) While we didn’t like Title II, it is the case that it put SOME rules 
in place to protect users.  Now those are gone and replaced with a flimsy 
notion of transparency.  
2) The U.S. needs a sustainable approach that isn’t at the whim of the 
courts or Presidential elections.  
3) This isn’t the time to give up on our goals - we will continue to 
fight for the principles that make the Internet open.  

Internet Stakeholders Meeting, Myanmar
The APAC Bureau organised a meeting with stakeholders from civil 
society, academia, media and the private sector to discuss issues of 
relevance and opportunities for collaboration in Yangon, Myanmar on 27 
November.

Field visit to Zimbabwe – Community Networks
ISOC African Bureau staff (ARB) met with one of the oldest community 
network teams in Africa - Muribinda Works. The objective was to assess 
the potential for wireless network development partnership and to engage 
key experts for future collaboration.  

Community Network (CN) and Internet exchange point (IXP) Development
ISOC staff have been working with a number of IXPs and CNs and have sent 
equipment to the following countries and/or held workshops to help 
develop CNs and IXPs. Switches and servers have been sent to the

Group Highlights
-----------------------
Decentralized InterNet (DINRG aka DINPRG) - 
Plans now set for a next meeting Feb 16, 2018, collocated with NDSS in 
San Diego.
ToDo: make sure they put out their meeting info in a broad announcement

HRPC -
Flagging one highlight about the IETF 100 activities, HRPC organized a 
hackathon group for a second time, and a good account of the results is 
in: https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/100/materials/slides-100-hrpc-
errata-to-rfc-7725-draft-new-protocol-elements-451-hr-considerations/

GAIA -
Discussion during the meeting around a presentation about volunteers 
recovering the Internet after this year's Mexico City earthquake has 
focused the group's thought on a document that shares operations 
solutions for harsh conditions.  

Document Updates 
--------------------------
IESG conflict review draft-irtf-nmrg-autonomic-sla-violation-detection 
was completed, with no revision needed.  Sent to RFC Editor

Conflict review on draft-irtf-cfrg-xmss-hash-based-signatures was 
discussed because of an IANA Not OK state, and it will be on the agenda 
again in January.  IANA Registry was requested with Expert Review, and 
IESG as well as Michelle Cotton requested comment on who should appoint 
this Expert.  The IRTF Chair has opined that if IESG is willing, it is 
reasonable in this case for IESG to appoint the Expert Reviewer, because 
the proposed registry is applicable to future standards track documents 
as well as to future IRTF stream documents. Awaiting outcome of this 
IESG Management Item. 

IRTF Chair still has some reviewing backlog, but will be sending more 
conflict review requests - for ICNRG and NVTRG - before the end of the 
year.

Other
-------
ANRP 2018 had nearly 60 submissions (most ever).  Because there are so 
many, the IRTF Chair pushed the response date back.  The review 
committee will meet in mid-December and responses will go out very 
rapidly thereafter.

The IRTF Chair understands that the Applied Network Research Workshop 
(ANRW) for 2018 has a green-light to run on Monday of the IETF week, as 
long as good effort is made to create tracks early on, so that Areas can 
try to schedule as few conflicts as possible with their tracks.  The 
goal is to have a higher rate of cross-over from workshop speakers/
attendees into the WG and RG meetings.  The IRTF and ACM are positioning 
ANRW to be an increasingly consequential workshop.

RFC Series Editor Update

- Format
Work progresses on the format tools being developed by ElfTools
(Publication formatter, text submission, and idnits). The remaining
tools in the set (svgcheck, RFClint, and XML Diff) have been sent back
out to bid, and the Tools Management Committee along with the RSE will
be reviewing the bids in December 2017. This may introduce a delay to
the overall project, but exact timeline implications will be determined
after a new vendor is selected for those tools.

See https://trac.tools.ietf.org/tools/ietfdb/wiki/FormatToolsPlan

- Digital Preservation With datatracker release v6.67.0, the RSS feed
capabilities have been expanded to allow for query by year. This was
done to support the Computer History Museum's efforts to take an annual
data dump of RFCs published in a given year. Many thanks to Robert
Sparks for this work.

RPC Update

- SLA
See: https://www.rfc-editor.org/report-summary/

The RPC is expecting a significant increase in submissions in the coming
quarter due to the following:

- outgoing ADs will be clearing their the plates
- expecting much of C238 to enter the queue (currently includes 20 docs
to be processed)
- expecting an expedited request for draft-wu-l3sm-rfc8049bis (185 pages) 
  (expected to be approved this week)

### 4. TC46 Liaison


Heather Flanagan reported that she spoke with Todd Carpenter about the IETF liaison with ISO TC46 in regards to fast-tracking RFC 8141 as an ISO standard. It turns out that the TC46 subcommittee SC9 is the group that the liaison relationship is needed with; in ISO, subcommittees do not inherit the liaison rights from their parent groups.


Ted Hardie will add a management item to the next IESG teleconference to confirm that the IESG is okay with creating a liaison relationship with ISOC TC46 subcommittee SC9 in order to fast track RFC 8141 as an ISO standard.


### 5. Future Tech Plenaries


Brian Trammell will follow up with Jane Coffin and Arjuna Sathiaseelan regarding potential speakers for IETF 101 plenary.


### 6. Choke Points


Mark Nottingham reported that he and Brian Trammell have started work on draft-iab-chokepoints, but the document has not yet been posted to the I-D repository. They hope to flesh the document out a bit more before posting the -00 version.


Jari Arkko noted that he had forked the draft in GitHub to start working on text about Internet consolidation.


### 7. IAB Next Steps on Consolidation


Jari Arkko said that he thinks the next step for the IAB on Internet consolidation is to have someone write something up for the IAB to discuss further.


Lee Howard asked if the IAB had enough information yet to do something useful (e.g. a document, workshop, or technical plenary).


Jari Arkko replied that the IAB needs to get its own thinking straightened out before a useful plenary topic could be proposed.


Jari Arkko agreed to draft text for a problem statement on Internet consolidation.


### 8. MaRNEW Next Steps


Brian Trammell reported that the IP Stack Evolution Program had discussed another potential workshop on Manageability of Encrypted Traffic (MoET). The Program sent the proposal to the Privacy and Security Program, which noted that the proposed workshop looked like it would parallel work already happening in the TLS Working Group.


In the ensuing discussions, the IP Stack Evolution Program identified two goals:


1. To give output about changes coming to the architecture
2. To receive input about the technical aspects of management that are being done in these networks.


The IAB noted that narrowing this to specific use cases might be more productive than trying to have one unifying theory.


Lee Howard noted that different conversations would provide different contexts, and it would be helpful to have operators involved in the discussions. He added that NANOG will happen in late February in Atlanta, and that might provide an opportunity for some folks from IETF and NANOG to have a conversation.


Ted Hardie observed that the critical piece is that the conversation is not one-sided. He suggested that the IAB might want to spend some time with the IESG talking about whether there is some systemic method for bringing this kind of feedback into the IETF; the IAB is responsible for IETF’s liaison relationship, but they lack the operational experience.


### 9. Meeting Minutes


The minutes of the 29 November 2017 business meeting and the 6 December 2017 tech chat and business meeting were approved.


### 10. Executive Session: RSOC Membership


The IAB discussed RSOC membership in an executive session.

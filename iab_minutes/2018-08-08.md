I.   Recent Papers

Meeting Europe's Connectivity Challenge: The Role for Community 
Networks; Brussels, 4 July 2018. 
A new paper commissioned by Internet Society on Meeting the Internet 
Connectivity Challenge – The Role for Community Networks, was  launched 
at CEPS in Brussels on 4 July 2018. The paper looks at the challenges 
and opportunities for community networks to set up, maintain and expand 
operations. It draws lessons learned from a selection of European 
projects. The overall conclusion is that successful community networks 
are possible to build, overcoming the digital divide and insuring that 
the remotest regions benefit from connecting to the Internet. (https://

#### 2.2. IRTF Chair Report


–Begin IRTF Chair Report, Allison Mankin–



```
IRTF Report for July 2018 (submitted August 8, 2018)

ANRW
The co-chairs for ANRW19 will be Jana Iyengar and Phillipa Gill.  
Phillipa is on the CS Faculty at University of Massachusetts (US).  
Note: final confirmation for Phillipa is pending.  Phillipa was on the 
ANRW18 TPC, and the ANRW18 co-chair, Sharon Goldberg, was her doctoral 
advisor.  Jana is well-known to the IAB, IESG and IRSG, of course.  Both 
co-chairs are distinguished in academic circles and ANRW will be very 
fortunate to have their leadership.  

As all know, in an experiment originally proposed by Sharon, ANRW18 took 
place on the Monday of IETF week, so that researchers and IETFers would 
mingle more.  The Secretariat supported scheduling to de-conflict 
topical sessions from WGs as much as possible, and RGs were not 
permitted to meet on the ANRW day. The goal of mingling was very well 
met.  IRTF’s recommendation is to hold the next ANRW on IETF Monday 
again, in Montreal next summer (IETF 105).  Results from the 
Secretariat’s survey questions about ANRW are still pending and will be 
taken into account. 

Based on figures pulled by Mat Ford, here are the numbers supporting 
this recommendation:

Total registered for ANRW18 in all categories - 104, increase of 40-60 
over ANRW17.
Of these, by their registration categories , 87 also participated in the 
IETF week.
Total IETFers not registered for ANRW who attended some session is 
unknown, but the room, which held over 200, was completely full for 
several sessions.
Newcomer Info
17 of those registered for ANRW were first-timers to any IETF
12 were people who had been to only 2-5 IETF meetings before. 


ANRP News
The ANRP awardees for IETF 103 will be “announced” and promoted starting 
in mid-September.  As previously reported, they are: 

Johanna Amann, ICSI, Mission Accomplished: HTTPS Security After 
DigiNotar, IMC 2017

Arash Molavi Kakhki, Thousand Eyes, Taking a Long Look at QUIC: An 
Approach for Rigorous Evaluation of Rapidly Evolving Transport 
Protocols, IMC 2017

IRTF is soon going to start the new cycle of ANRP-selection.  Folks 
wishing to be on the selection TPC should send a direct mail to IRTF-
Chair - we will have a balance of past awardees and IRTF/IETF folks in 
this TPC.

Status of Research Groups 
Proposed
Path-Aware Networking (PANRG) moved from Proposed RG to RG

Distributed Internet Infrastructure Proposed RG  (DINRG) is in review 
for move to RG, now, with IRSG about to give their comments. 

There was no announce tool hook-up for IRTF Chair, but Alexa Morris has 
fixed this problem, so look also for a request for comments on the DINRG 
promotion on the IRTF-Discuss mailing list.

Concluded
Network Function Virtualization RG (NFVRG) will be moved to Concluded as 
soon as one document is sent for Conflict Review this week.  

Potential Research Groups
There are currently three requests for RG in IRTF Chair review.  The 
furthest along, and the only one with a full charter draft, is for new 
research into infosecurity defense, proposed by Kirsty Paine, National 
Cyber Security Centre.  Kathleen Moriarty has worked on the proposal 
too, and is interested in serving co-RG chair.  

IAB RG Reviews
The IAB reviewed CFRG during its Thursday business meeting in Montreal.

IRTF Tools
The datatracker now has a Shepherd facility for the RG Chairs and IRTF 
Chair to use - thanks to Robert Sparks!

Other improvements supporting IRTF Workflow are still in the backlog.  A 
request to support the IRSG review and ballot process with tooling may 
be shifted over to non-IETF tools.

RSE
* IETF 102
After an intense IETF 102 meeting, the RSE came away with the 
understanding that the questions regarding how individuals interpret (or 
fail to notice) the different streams and statuses possible within the 
RFC Series is an important, but not particularly urgent, problem. 
Addressing these concerns is on the list of things for the RSE to 
consider, and discussions have started with individuals experienced with 
questions around marketing and branding on how to best address the 
issues involved. In terms of priority, however, it is lower on the list 
than seeing documents published as RFCs and completing the RFC format 
effort.

* RFC Format
Megan Ferguson, Heather Flanagan, Paul Hoffman, Henrik Levkowetz, Alice 
Russo, Jim Schaad, and Robert Sparks met during IETF 102 to discuss the 
state of the RFC format tools. Many of the required tools are being 
tested by the RPC; the community will be solicited to help with general 
user testing after the first round of testing is completed by the RPC. 
For issues found that will require updating the various requirement 
documents (see RFCs 7990-7998) issues will be opened in the appropriate 
GitHub repository (https://github.com/rfc-format) and discussed on the 
xml2rfc-dev@ietf.org mailing list (https://www.ietf.org/mailman/
listinfo/xml2rfc-dev).

See https://trac.tools.ietf.org/tools/ietfdb/wiki/FormatToolsPlan for 
information on the expected release schedule for the various tools.

* Fifty Years of RFCs
2019 will mark the fiftieth year of publishing RFCs. The RSE is starting 
work on writing a document to commemorate that milestone, and has 
reached out to several key individuals to offer their thoughts on the 
past, present, and future of the series.


RPC
* https://www.rfc-editor.org/report-summary/
See the reports page for the latest information on the SLA.

The RPC had a productive meeting at IETF 102, meeting with authors and 
readers of RFCs, the stream managers, and the developers of the v3 
format tools.

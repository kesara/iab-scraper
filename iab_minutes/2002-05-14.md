### NOTES


**0. Rollcall, Agenda Bash and Previous Minutes**
 Minutes of previous meeting ([9 April 2002](/documents/minutes/minutes-2002/iab-minutes-2002-04-09/)) confirmed.
 
**1. Review of Action Items** 


 ( [below](#actions))
 
 **2. Review of Documents** 


 ([below](#documents))
 
 **3. Liaison Reports** 

**IESG**:  

 It was reported that the IESG offsite retreat will be held next week in the Netherlands.
 **PSO-PC**:  

 The PSO General Assembly will take place on Wednesday, 19 June, at the ITU Headquarters, Geneva, starting at 16:00 CET. The PSO GA will be hold in conjunction with the ITU-Telecommunication Standardization Advisory Group meeting. At this stage neither IETF PSO-PC member can commit to attend this meeting. An IETF nominee, preferablly based nearby, is being sought.  

 The ISO application to join the PSO will be considered again at the next PSO PC meeting, scheduled for the 31st May, following the submission of additional supporting material by ISO. 


 **RFC Editor**:  

 The IAB thanked the staff at ISI who had maintained the IAB mailing list for so many years as a part of the RFC Editor role.  

 The RFC rsync trial is now underway, and reports on the use of rsync as a means of maintaining a mirror of the RFC document collection are sought.  

 Tony Hain’s effort in generating a MS Word RFC template is to be published as a means of assisting RFC authors to generate appropriately formatted RFC documents. 


 **ISOC**:  

 Lynn St Amour noted that the changes to the ISOC governance model are progressing. The 2002 Trustee Election results will be announced on the 31st May, and this announcement will include the IETF-nominated Trustees. Funding ISOC continues to be an important consideration for the ISOC Board.  

 INET’2002 will be held on 18-21 June 2002 in Washington DC. 


 **IRTF**:  

 The [NameSpace research group](http://www.irtf.org/charters/namespace.html) has a [draft report](http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-irtf-nsrg-report-03.txt) in Research Group last call. The RG has indicated an interest to present on this report at the Yokohama IETF Plenary. The options regarding future directions for this effort were discussed.  

 A proposed research group working in the area of the application of cryptography is being considered, and this will be passed to the IAB for comment shortly. A Measurement research group proposal is also under consideration at present.  

 Also being considered is the rechartering of the Interplanetary Internet research group to allow for applied research of the underlying concepts used by this group in the area of messaging-based networking. 


 **ISO**:  

 ( [below](#5)) 


**4. ITU/ENUM update**


 The IAB was informed that the ENUM arrangements are proceeding in the anticipated direction, although there are a number of further ratification steps within the ITU process. A number of codes corresponding to E.164 country codes have been delegated as per the documented process.
 The IAB discussed correspondance received from the Directorate General of Telecommunication of Taiwan concerning the ITU’s objection to an application to delegate 6.8.8.e164.arpa. It was recognised that this is a matter within the purview of the ITU to determine appropriate delegation of E.164 country codes, as per the ENUM delegation management processes, although some clarification regarding the appropriate disposition of E.164 “reserved” codes was to be sought from ENUM experts. 


**5. ISO liaisons**


 The IAB approved the following liaisons to ISO bodies:
**ISO/IEC JTC1 SC2** – Pete Resnick  

**ISO/IEC JTC1 SC18/21** – David Chadwick  

**ISO/IEC JTC1 SC29** – Steve Casner
 
**6. Review of Individual RFC submissions**


 The IAB endorsed a proposal to assist the IESG in the review of individual submissions to the RFC Editor, allowing an Area Director to refer the document to the IAB for comment, particularly where the document has architectural or cross-area implications.
 It was noted that the document review process may include a member ballot. It was noted that there would need to be some process and supporting tools to ensure that this review is conducted in an organized manner. It was also noted that such tools could be used for other matters that may requre all-IAB attention and signoff. It was requested that the review management tools allow both online and email-based interaction by IAB members. 


**7.** **IAB.ORG transition**


 The transition of the mailing list to an IETF Secretariat-hosted mailer has now been completed. The IAB web pages will also be relocated to an IETF Secretariat-hosted server as the next part of this exercise.

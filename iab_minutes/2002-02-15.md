### NOTES


#### 1. Review of NomCom proposed IESG slate

The IAB reviewed the additional input provided by the NomCom to accompany the proposed IESG slate. The slate was accepted.


 In the course of the discussions of the various Areas and issues, the suggestion was made that it is perhaps time to review the structure and process of the IETF, in plenary, to confirm or revise the structure that has been in place for several years. 



### FUTURE MEETINGS



Regular teleconference second Tuesday of the month 1500-1700 US East Coast time.

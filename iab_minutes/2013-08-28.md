Internet Society Liaison Report to the IAB
27 August 2013

Topics:

I. ISOC Briefing Panel
II. IETF Policy Program
III. ITU - WTDC
IV. ITU - Plenipot
V. Post-WCIT Combating Spam Project
VI. Upcoming ISOC Webinar on Internet Governance and participation opportunities

I. ISOC Briefing Panel
ISOC had a successful briefing panel during the IETF87 meeting in
Berlin. The topic was "Improving Internet Experience: All together,
now", and panelists discussed quality of experience requirements and
implications from different perspectives (networking, application and
OS). Video and audio recordings are available here:
http://www.internetsociety.org/internet-society-briefing-panel-ietf-87

II. IETF Policy Program
The policy program for IETF87 was a great success. We had our largest
group yet of policymakers and the feedback was overwhelmingly positive
about the experience and the opportunities for further collaboration in
the future. We are already planning for IETF88 and are expecting roughly
10 guests in Vancouver. This group will largely come from the Latin
American region - part of our effort to build up collaboration in the
run-up to a possible IETF meeting in the region.

III. ITU - WTDC
The ITU hosted a Regional Preparatory Meeting for the WTDC in Montevideo
on 26-30 August to prepare the region's input to the WTDC. The Internet
Society contributed to the meeting (http://www.internetsociety.org/doc/
contribution-regional-preparatory-meeting-americas-2014-wtdc) and had
two people participating in the RPM. The issue of the role of
governments in Internet governance mechanisms was raised by Brazil and,
ultimately, a compromise text was reached to strengthen the capacity of
developing countries to participate in Internet governance mechanisms.

IV. ITU - Plenipot
ISOC is working to stand up a webpage for the Plenipot and is drafting a
background paper that ISOC members and the IAB may use to come up-to-
speed on the issues. The first early discussions on proposals and ideas
is emerging from the Asia Pacific region as well as within a few of the
Council working groups. One issue that may be of interest to the IAB is
the question of how the ITU defines the term "ICTs" for purposes of ITU
scope and mandate.

V. Post-WCIT Combating Spam Project
The project has two developing country workshops scheduled for 2013;
Nairobi, Kenya on September 9th and Mendoza, Argentina on October 7th.
The focus of these workshops is to present to policy makers the
industry’s best practices and tools in combating spam as well as to have
a dialogue on the role of governments as a partner with the technical
community in addressing the issue of spam mitigation.

VI. Upcoming ISOC Webinar on Internet Governance and participation
opportunities
ISOC is organizing a webinar on 19 September on key Internet governance
events and the opportunities for all to participate in important
consultation processes (CSTD, WSIS, etc.) This graphic does not intend
to be exhaustive but provides a perspective (2003-2016) on a few of
these milestones that are of interest to our community:
http://www.internetsociety.org/sites/default/files/ig%20milestones%20_0.pdf

- CSTD: The UN CSTD Working Group on Enhanced Cooperation has issued a
questionnaire soliciting views on Enhanced Cooperation. The
questionnaire is open to any relevant stakeholder involved in
Internet-related public policy issues. Views on this important issue
should be submitted by 31 August 2013:
http://unctad.org/en/Pages/cstd.aspx

- ISOC Questionnaire on Multistakeholder Participation: The Internet
Society launched a survey to gain greater insights into
multistakeholder governance perceptions and processes at all levels –
national, regional, and international. The questionnaire is open to
all interested participants and is available until 30 September 2013:
https://internetsociety2.wufoo.com/forms/internet-society/

- IGF 2013: The IGF 2013 will be held from 22-25 October in Bali,
Indonesia. The overarching theme proposed by the MAG for the 2013 IGF
meeting is: "Building Bridges - Enhancing Multistakeholder Cooperation
for Growth and Sustainable Development". For further information
regarding the programme paper, the meeting or the venue, visit the
IGF's (http://www.intgovforum.org/cms/) and ISOC’s websites.

- WTDC-14: The ITU World Telecommunication Development Conference is
taking place in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, from 31 March to 11 April
2014. The objective of WTDC-14 is to identify priorities for the
development of telecommunications and ICTs, taking into account
contributions made by ITU Member States and Sector Members, and to
adopt the Sharm el-Sheik Action Plan (SSAP) setting future activities
of the ITU Telecommunication Development Sector (ITU-D) over the next
four years. Six Regional Preparatory Meetings (RPMs) are taking place
in 2013 in preparation for WTDC-14. More information on participation
modalities is available here: http://www.internetsociety.org/
development/world-telecommunication-development-conference-wtdc

- ITU’s Strategic Plan 2016-2019: Individuals are invited to submit
their comments by 6 September. Submissions may be provided on the
ITU's platform (http://www.itu.int/PublicConsultations), or directly
to strategy@itu.int.

- WSIS+10 Process: The WSIS+10 High Level Event will be organized by the
ITU on 13-17 April 2014, in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. Following on the
first phase of the WSIS Review process initiated by UNESCO in February
this year, this extended version of the WSIS Forum will assess
progress made in the implementation of the WSIS outcomes (2003 and
2005) related to the WSIS Action Lines, with a view to developing
proposals on a new vision beyond 2015, potentially exploring new
targets. The preparatory process is comprised of an Open Consultation
Process that will produce two draft Outcome Documents: 1/ a draft WSIS
+10 Statement on the Implementation of WSIS Outcomes and 2/ a draft
WSIS+10 Vision for WSIS Beyond 2015 under mandates of participating
agencies: http://www.itu.int/wsis/review/mpp/

Input on these two documents is open to all WSIS stakeholders and can be
provided until 20 September 2013. Proposals on themes & innovative
approaches for the event's format are also sought by the same date. ISOC
will continue to be very engaged in this process going forward:

#### 2.3. IRTF Chair


–Begin IRTF Chair Report, Lars Eggert–



```
- The usual lull after a meeting.

- Continuing discussions with the proponents of the NWCRG about how we
can make sure that an RG in this space is open for many different
approaches to network coding, esp. from non-US groups.

- Discussion with ACM SIGCOMM. They want to attract more industry, we
want to attract more researchers. ISOC (Leslie) is also thinking about
what can be done here.
```

#### 2.4. RFC Editor Liaison


–Begin RFC Editor Liaison Report, Heather Flanagan–



```
1. RSE report:
* RFC Format Design Team
Team includes: Nevil Brownlee, Heather Flanagan (RSE), Tony Hansen, Joe
Hildebrand, Paul Hoffman, Ted Lemon, Julian Reshke, Alice Russo, Robert
Sparks (Tools Team liaison), Dave Thaler
The team is currently working on mock-ups of the different proposed
publication formats and discussing different potential transformation
processes. This is largely the brainstorming component of the team's
activities. We are on a biweekly call schedule, with our second call
happening later today.

* RPC and Publisher SoW
After a public comment period, the SoW has been modified and returned to
the IAOC for final review.

* Style Guide update
A revised draft will be posted on Wednesday, 4 September 2013, at which
point note will go out to the RSAG when the new draft is posted to get
their opinions on the various changes. After the RSAG review, a note
will go to rfc-interest to get feedback on the new proposed Style Guide.
The RSOC will also be asked to review the draft and decide if this is
ready to go to the IAB for consideration as an IAB document.

* RFC Editor meeting in mid-September
A face to face meeting is planned for key RPC staff and the RSE in mid-
September to review and revise plans around current priorities and
continue work on Style Guide

2. RFC Production Center:
* xx00 retirement status
An update was posted to draft-rfced-rfcxx00-retired-04 to remove mention
of retirement of STD1 and point to the appropriate retirement document
drafted by the IESG.

* xx99 retirement status
We are working on an announcement to notify the community that we will
officially no longer being publishing the xx99 summary documents (see
details in draft-rfced-rfcxx99-retired). This practice was never
documented in an RFC, so the RSOC recommended that a simple statement
would be sufficient.

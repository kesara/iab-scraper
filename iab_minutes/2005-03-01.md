### 4. Liaison Reports



The following Liaison Reports were submitted to the IAB.


#### Global Grid Forum


Brian Carpenter:


* Brian will be standing down as the IETF liaison to the GGF, and the need for a replacement liaison was flagged to the IAB.
* Mark Linesch has been recently appointed as chair of the GGF.
* It has been informally reported that the proposed coordination activity for network management and configuration management activity will be hosted by the GGF. It is noted that the IETF hasn’t formally signed up in this coordinated effort. Once the form of the GGF-hosted activity is clear, the IETF may need to reconsider this position.


#### Unicode Forum


Patrik Fältström:


* Nothing reported back on UAX #15.
Issue #61: Proposed Update UAX #15 Unicode Normalization Forms A proposed update to UAX #15 for Unicode 4.1.0 is available. The proposed changes are listed in the Modifications section of the document.  

<http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr15/tr15-24.html>
* Draft of draft 3 of TR36 is ready as  

<http://unicode.org/reports/tr36/draft/>
Especially one can point out:


	+ <http://unicode.org/reports/tr36/draft/confusables.txt> is a start on characters that are confusable, and thus can cause some domain names to be rejected (see the text on how this would work).
	+ <http://unicode.org/reports/tr36/draft/special_purpose.txt> is a start on characters that are to be excluded (at some security level).
	+ <http://unicode.org/reports/tr36/draft/idn-chars.html> is all the characters allowed in international domain names.


#### IEEE 802


Bernard Aboba:


* 802.11 has been requested to review the IAB draft on Link Indications. 802.11u and possibly 802.21 will undertake this review.
* 802.1 has submitted no comment on the EAP Network Selection draft
* 802.11 has completed the review of the CAPWAP documents.
* Comments have been received from 802 of the TRILL WG proposed charter. No comments have been received on the LOWPAN WG proposed charter to date.
* the BMWG chairs have requested an informal liaison with 802.11T.

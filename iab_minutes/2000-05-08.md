### NOTES:


#### 1. Minutes of previous meeting


#### 2. Review of action items

see above


#### 3. Administrivia

**ICANN Nomcom**
 **IESG review of IAB documents**… should IESG have to approve IAB documents? One argument is that IESG should be in review loop only as they are in the loop for other Informational RFCs; other argument is that the IAB is in some sense superior to IESG and thus its documents are not subject to IESG review. Real issue is some large IESG delays.  

**Consensus:** IAB will commit to reviewing IAB and IRTF documents in sufficient detail that they are in good shape before being sent to IESG. Then, the two week time-out deadline for IESG review should be firm.  

**Next step:** Open email discussion with IESG. 


#### 4. IRTF report and news

Erik traveling.


#### 5. IESG liaison report and news


#### 6. Workshop report status


 QOS – Huston  

Network Layer Workshop

#### 7. IAB Mailing list and spam

About the same level. No action.


#### 8. IRTF bypass procedure for RFC publications

Argument is that IRTF documents should not be reviewed by IESG because it is a peer-organization to the IETF. On the other side, the IESG has stepped up to reviewing Informational RFCs in order to insure quality.


#### 9. .ARPA status

Agreement on the use of the ARPA TLD as an infrastructure domain has progressed to the point that working groups, notably IPNGWG, can be notified of that plan and that the IAB statement should be posted to the IAB web page. We are still discussing with ICANN the questions of use of the domain by other SDOs and the review/ delegation process.


#### 10. Appeals, pending appeals, and boilerplate


#### 11. Task list sorting

Themes:

- Security (integrity of infrastructure and routing)
- Intl (charsets & identifiers)

#### 12. Dominance by single organization

Closure on lengthy email thread.


 **Consensus:** Encourage “real time” publishing of NomCom volunteers as they come in, along with their organizational affiliation.

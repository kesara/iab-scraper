### 1. ISOC IOT Campaign


Steve Olshansky joined the IAB to discuss the Internet Society’s IoT Campaign. The objectives of the campaign are:


* Make the Online Trust Alliance IoT Trust Framework global
* Consumer drive demand for security and privacy in IoT
* Policy and regulations driving better security and privacy features in IoT.


Ted Hardie observed that the campaign is elucidating principles that people should follow, but it does not get down into the details, which could result in having different approaches that do not interoperate well. He asked if there was an intent to turn this into standards work in the future.


Olaf Kolkman replied that at the moment it is more about raising awareness and pointing to standardization work that already happening elsewhere, rather actually doing the standardization work.


Christian Huitema noted that some of the problems are market issues; there is a relationship between ad-funded business models and having a surveillance society.


Allison Mankin observed that consumers did not know what happens with the data from their smart devices once it leaves their homes.


Olaf Kolkman replied that issue is more general than just IoT.


Brian Trammell noted that many IoT devices are already not complying with the minimal legal requirements regarding transparency and control. There should be principles for the architectures of those systems, and what happens to the data. Olaf Kolkman replied that the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will apply to IoT as much as it will to anything else.


Ted Hardie noted that the IAB would be happy to review any future Internet Society white papers on this topic.


### 2. Executive Session: IAB Chair Selection


In an executive session, the IAB selected Ted Hardie as the IAB Chair for 2018-2019.


### 3. IAB Program Leadership


The IAB discussed the leadership of various IAB Programs.


Jari Arkko will remain the IAB Lead for the IANA Program. The IAB took an action to find someone to take over approval of root zone changes from Ted Hardie.


Brian Trammell will remain the IAB Lead for the IP Stack Evolution Program.


Mark Nottingham will take over as the IAB Lead for the Liaison Oversight Program.


Brian Trammell and Melinda Shore will be IAB co-Leads for the Plenary Planning Program. Brian noted that he would like to step down from this position after IETF 102, but that the Program should continue to have two co-Leads.


Martin Thomson will remain the IAB Lead for the Privacy and Security Program for now; the IAB will discuss the Program further at the IAB retreat in April.


Robert Sparks will remain the IAB Lead for the RFC Series Oversight Committee (RSOC).


### 4. Internal Liaisons


The IAB’s liaison to the IESG and the IAB’s liaison to the 2018-2019 NomCom will be finalized later this week.


Cindy Morgan will send pointers to the IAB wiki pages with past advice to IAB NomCom liaisons.


### 5. Liaison Shepherds


The IAB reviewed the IAB shepherds for the various IETF liaison relationships, and made the following changes:


* Brian Trammell will be the liaison shepherd for CableLabs.
* Martin Thomson will be the liaison shepherd for ECMA TC39.
* Suzanne Woolf will be the liaison shepherd for ICANN NomCom.


### 6. Internationalization Statement


The IAB approved the text of the [IAB Statement on Identifiers and Unicode](https://www.iab.org/documents/correspondence-reports-documents/2018-2/iab-statement-on-identifiers-and-unicode/) via e-vote prior to the start of the meeting.

MINUTES
---------------------------------

1. Introductions, Goals of the meeting

  The attendees of the meeting all briefly introduced themselves.

  Pat Thaler outlined the high-level goals of the meeting, noting that
  focus would be on how to improving collaboration between the IEEE 802
  and the IETF.

  Bernard Aboba noted that in March 2006, RFC 4441
  [https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc4441/] was published, outlining
  the relationship between IEEE 802 and the IETF at that time.  Bernard
  suggested that the discussions during this meeting might result in an
  update to RFC 4441. 

2. Introduction to IETF Areas, how IETF works, how decisions are made,
   how liaisons are managed

   Slides: "Introduction to the IETF Standards Process,"
   http://www.ietf.org/iesg/ieee/20120725/IETF-and-IEEE802-Leaders-2012-07.ppt

  Russ Housley delivered a brief overview of the IETF Standards process,
  noting that the IETF mission statement is outlined in RFC 3935
  [https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc3935/].  Russ explained that the
  IETF publishes their standards as RFCs, noting that over the last 10
  years, 90% of the RFCs have come from the IETF, with the rest coming
  from other streams, including the Internet Architecture Board (IAB),
  Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) and Independent Submission
  Editor (ISE).  The IETF uses an open standards process where all
  interested people are invited to participate, and decisions are made
  collaboratively.  

  Working Groups (WGs) are the primary mechanism for development of
  specifications and guidelines in the IETF.  Proposed charters are sent
  to the IETF community for review and comment, as well as to the new-
  work mailing list, which includes representatives from a number of
  other SDOs.  The IESG approves WG charters with IAB input.  Once a WG
  is chartered, participation is open to all.  The WG Chair sets the
  agenda for meetings, appoints document editors, and determines when
  rough consensus has been reached.

  The IETF maintains a number of liaison relationships with other SDOs.
  The IAB appoints individuals who serve as liaison managers
  [http://www.ietf.org/liaison/managers.html], and all liaison
  statements are posted publicly [https://datatracker.ietf.org/liaison].

3. Introduction to IEEE 802 WGs, how IEEE 802 works, how decisions are
   made, how liaisons are managed 

   Slides: "Introduction to the IEEE,"
   http://www.ietf.org/iesg/ieee/20120725/ieee-introduction.ppt

  Pat Thaler delivered a brief overview of the IEEE standards process.
  Working groups are responsible for developing standards in an area,
  and may have multiple active projects. The Technical Advisory Group
  (TAG) is a group of experts on a topic area that crosses working
  groups.  Task groups/task forces are parts of a working group which
  focus on a particular project or group of projects.

  A Project Authorization Request (PAR) is the charter for an IEEE
  standards project.  A Call For Interest (CFI) is a brief meeting to
  outline a topic and determine if there is investigating a possible
  projects.  Study Groups are formed to investigate a project and
  produce a PAR and Five Criteria (broad market potential,
  compatibility, distinct identity, technical feasibility, economic
  feasibility).  

  The question arose as to whether IEEE 802 has a web page where
  it lists the liaisons to other organizations.  At present there
  is no such web page. 

4. Collaborating & managing the relationship 

   Slides: "IETF-IEEE Relationship - RFC 4441 Summary,"
   http://www.ietf.org/iesg/ieee/20120725/RFC-4441-Summary.pptx

  Spencer Dawkins summarized the relationship between the IETF and IEEE
  802 as outlined in RFC 4441.  Key points include:

  - Liaisons are appointed between the organizations as needed
  - IETF participants can access IEEE archives
  - IEEE subscribes to the new-work mailing list and posts PARs
  - IETF "MIB doctors" review IEEE 802 MIBs
  - IETF EAP WG reviews IEEE EAP requirements as well as
    IEEE 802-supplied draft text
  - IEEE 802 requests new AAA applications; IETF reviews IEEE 802 AAA
    extensions

  Bernard Aboba noted that since RFC 4441 was published, some of the
  IETF MIB work has been transferred to 802.1 and 802.3.  Also, the EAP
  WG has closed and for liaison purposes has been succeeded by the EMU
  WG. 

5. Specific areas where collaboration is needed

5.1. IETF MIF & IEEE 802.21
     Slides: "IETF MIF & IEEE 802.21,"
     http://www.ietf.org/iesg/ieee/20120725/IEEE_802-21_IETF_MIF.PPTX

  Subir Das presented an overview of proposed work in the IETF MIF WG
  that may overlap with work done in IEEE 802.21, and made the following
  recommendations:

  - IETF MIF should not re-do the work that 802.21 has already done
    * 802.21 defines a Media Independent Services SAP (API) that
      provides most of the functionalities that MIF is looking for
    * 802.21 also defines low level Media Specific SAPs for the
      underlying access technologies
  - IETF MIF should identify requirements and make references to 802.21
    SAPs where appropriate
    * If non-existing functionalities are identified both MIF and 802.21
      should work together 

5.2. IEEE OmniRAN for Heterogeneous Networks
     Slides: "IEEE OmniRAN for Heterogeneous Networks,"
     http://www.ietf.org/iesg/ieee/20120725/IEEE_OmniRAN_IETF.pptx

  Roger Marks presented a proposal for a new IEEE 802 WG to specify
  access network abstraction layer above IEEE 802 access technologies,
  noting that the work is related to some IETF WGs (e.g. DMM, MIF,
  NETEXT), and made the following recommendations:  

  - IEEE 802 OmniRAN can close the gap and tie 802 devices into a family
    of standards within a heterogeneous IP network supporting evolving
    IETF standards
  - IEEE 802 and IETF should…
    * leverage each other's expertise
    * plan communications
    * identify commonalities
    * link solutions
    * organize a team to coordinate milestones and progress

5.3. BFD to detect Link Aggregation link failures
     Slides: "BFD to detect LinkAgg link failures,"
     http://www.ietf.org/iesg/ieee/20120725/bfd-and-lacp-issue-v2.ppt

  Norman Finn noted that drafts have been written (but not adopted in
  IETF WGs) for using BFD to detect Link Aggregation failures.  Norman
  suggested that BFD is at the wrong layer for this, and suggested the
  following ways to avoid layer violations:

  - Invent and use a Layer 3 equivalent of LACP that fits routing and
    BFD
  - Use Ether OAM; work with 802.1 to invent a way to avoid needless
    configuration.
  - Encapsulate BFD below LinkAgg thus giving the world two ways to do
    exactly the same thing. 

5.4. TRILL: Fine-Grained Labeling
     Slides, "TRILL: Fine-Grained Labeling "
     http://www.ietf.org/iesg/ieee/20120725/Trill-FineGrainedLabel.ppt

  Paul Unbehagen presented a brief summary of the IETF TRILL WG work on
  Fine-Grained Labeling which raises concerns about the use of the
  existing 0x8100 Ethertype.  IEEE 802 suggested that new protocols
  should require new Ethertypes.

5.5. IETF NV03 and IEEE 802.1 DCB

  Dan Romascanu noted that work in the newly-formed IETF NVO3 WG may
  overlap with work in the IEEE 802.1 Data Center Bridging Task Group.
  All parties involved agreed to watch these developments and intervene
  if necessary.

5.6. Transfer of Ethernet MIB work from IETF to IEEE 802.3 

  Benoit Claise briefly described the process of transferring the work
  from now concluded IETF HUBMIB WG to the IEEE 802.3 WG. The issue was
  discussed in the break with Howard Frazier and Dan Romascanu. Most of
  the open issues were agreed, and there is also agreement on co-
  authoring an Informational RFC that will document the MIB transfer
  process. 

6. Impact of virtualization on the architecture of IEEE 802 and IETF
   protocols

   Slides: "IEEE Registration Authority: Virtualization & OUI Tiers,"
   http://www.ietf.org/iesg/ieee/20120725/RAC_Virtualization_July2012.pdf

  Glenn Parsons presented a brief overview of the IEEE Registration
  Authority Committee (RAC) mission, highlighting the current RAC policy
  on virtualization and asking what virtualization policy would reduce
  the consumption of EUI-48 addresses.  Norman Finn suggested this could
  be an area of collaboration between the IETF and the IEEE 802.

7. Action items, follow-up methods, plans for next meeting 

  Paul Nikolich and Russ Housley suggested another face-to-face meeting
  in March 2013, as the IEEE 802 and the IETF will hold back-to-back
  meetings in Orlando, Florida.  In the meantime, the liaison managers
  will arrange bimonthly conference calls, with the participants for
  each call depending on the agenda.

  The following action items were identified:

  - Spencer Dawkins, Eric Gray, Dan Romascanu, Dorothy Stanley and Pat
    Thaler agreed to work on an update to RFC 4441.

  - Howard Frazier and Dan Romascanu agreed to write an Informational
    RFC that will document the MIB transfer process. 

  - The IEEE 802 agreed to review and update the people they currently
    have subscribed to the new-work mailing list, and to send PARs to
    new-work.

  - The IEEE 802 agreed to add a page to their website listing their
    current liaison relationships.

  - The IEEE 802 will look at removing mailing list restrictions that
    prevent IETF participants from contributing to IEEE 802 work.

  - The IESG agreed to draft an IESG Statement regarding Ethertype
    Requests.

  - The IAB and IESG will suggest a process for providing feedback to
    the IEEE RAC on Virtualization and OUI Tiers.

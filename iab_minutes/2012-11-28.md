  Internet Society Liaison Report to the IAB
  27 November 2012

  Topics:
   I. Briefing panel - Internet Untethered
  II. Internet Technology Matters
  III. World Telecommunications Standardization Assembly 2012 (WTSA)
  IV. Internet Governance Forum
   V. World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)
  VI. WSIS Forum

  I. Briefing panel – Internet Untethered
  On November 6, ISOC held a briefing panel session at the IETF meeting 
  venue.  The topic started out focusing on the need to move mobile data 
  networks towards Internet services, but rapidly moved from that to 
  focusing on platform lock-in (iOS, Android, etc). See 
  http://www.internetsociety.org/events/ietf-85 for more details and a 
  recording of the session.

  II. Internet Technology Matters
  We have established a technology-audience specific section of the 
  Internet Society webspace, and are building up social media functions 
  around that.  See "Internet Technology Matters" and blog posts here: 
  http://www.internetsociety.org/what-we-do/internet-technology-
  matters.  Social media links are:

  III. World Telecommunications Standardization Assembly 2012 (WTSA)
  At the time of writing this report, WTSA was about to conclude the 
  first week of its work. Some of the highlights so far:
    1.   G.8113.1 (MPLS) At the opening plenary, all draft 
    Recommendations (including G.8113.1 and G.8113.2) that were sent to 
    WTSA were approved. The Routing Area received a liaison related to 
    G.8113.1 and IANA has already processed the request and issued a ACh 
    codepoint, as the normative reference to G.8113.1 in draft-betts-
    itu-oam-ach-code-point, which is now RFC6671. 
    2.   New ITU-T Workplan Review Group:  Japan has proposed a new 
    group to focus on strategic review and assignment of the work of the 
    ITU-T (this is of interest to the IETF).  There is some question 
    about the organization of this group, its composition, who it is 
    accountable to, and the extent to which liaison representatives from 
    other SDOs will be included.
    3.   Res.75 WSIS (ITU-T contribution in implementing the outcomes of 
    the World Summit on the Information Society): Linkages to the 
    Council Working Group on International Internet-Related Public 
    Policy Issues is one of the issues under consideration. This group 
    is for governments only. Clearly, an intergovernmental group to 
    address Internet issues is inconsistent with the WSIS Declaration of 
    Principals.  There is significant concern with any expansion in the 
    role of that group, particularly when the documentation for this 
    group is not visible.
    4.  References to ITRs:  a number of proposals specifically 
    reference the future ITRs – this has been very controversial.  The 
    ITU Secretariat has resisted forward-looking references to the ITRs, 
    recognizing that the WTSA can’t reference a forward-looking event.  
    This hasn’t been resolved yet.
    5. IPv6: Concerns have been expressed by developing countries 
    relating to IPv4-IPv6 transition, particularly their lack of skills 
    and expertise in managing the transition.  Arab States raised the 
    issue of allocation of addresses again.  Still unresolved.
    6. Quality of Service:  QoS issues have come up in the context of 
    Res. 40 regarding Regulatory Aspects of the ITU-T work. The 
    discussion is still open, with discussions now focusing on language 
    suggesting taking a longer term approach with further study taking 
    into account studies being carried out in relevant study groups, 
    with the timeline to report to the next WTSA.
    7.  ITU-T Strategic Plan and Collaboration with other groups 
    (including SDOs): There is a significant question on how to 
    reconcile the need for the ITU-T to collaborate with others and the 
    desire by some for ITU pre-eminence (a subtext to the discussion).   
    Delegations are still debating terminology about:
    - Duplication of efforts
    - Mechanisms for collaboration
    - Minimization of conflict and overlap of standards and standards 
      activities
    - Cooperation on an “equal footing”
    8. Other issues that have been tabled include:
    Net neutrality:  proposal to include net neutrality in Study Group 2
    Cybersecurity: how to include cybersecurity throughout SG 
    activities.  Possible ITU-T activities on CERTs
    Combatting Spam: role of ITU-T
    ITU mark / conformance & interoperability – no consensus yet

  IV. Internet Governance Forum
  The 7th Internet Governance Forum (IGF) was held in Baku, Azerbaijan 
  from 5 to 9 November. It gathered over 1500 participants from 128 
  countries, including a significant number of Ministers and senior 
  officials. There was a heavy emphasis on human rights and the human 
  rights record of the host country. The reaction of local bloggers and 
  human rights activists validated the choice of the host country. They 
  made it clear that they welcomed holding the IGF meeting in Baku, as 
  it gave them a platform to make their voice heard.

  The Internet Society's community was actively engaged and visible at 
  the event. The complete list of ISOC activities and speaking roles in 
  Baku is available here: 
  http://www.internetsociety.org/igf/2012-internet-governance-forum/igf-2012-activities-list

  Human Rights was one of the central and cross-cutting themes discussed 
  this year, with an impressive figure of more than 30 sessions making 
  reference to human rights related issues. The wealth of discussions 
  and the diversity of actors involved in the debates that took place in 
  Baku illustrated an important shift towards considering human rights 
  and their online dimension as a multi-stakeholder issue, requiring a 
  strong cooperation among all relevant actors, including the technical 
  community. Perhaps one of the most striking takeaways from this IGF 
  was to hear from local bloggers and human rights activists about the 
  value of the IGF as a space empowering them with the ability to speak 
  freely and share ideas and opinions in their own country, for example 
  shedding light on local freedom of speech issues. This provides an 
  interesting local perspective on the validity of the IGF model as a 
  framework to foster open discussions, even in countries where online 
  and offline freedoms are being challenged.

  WCIT was also a key undercurrent in many of the IGF workshops and 
  sessions as WCIT will start on December 2nd with the potential 
  outcomes having an impact on the Internet and its open functionality. 
  Questions were raised in these sessions regarding the role of Internet 
  Governance and the Internet in a treaty that focuses on global 
  telecommunications. ISOC co-organized a workshop on the ITRs, WCIT and 
  Internet Governance, which generated an engaged debate among the 
  panelists and participants on the need to revisit the 1988 treaty text 
  that some felt encouraged the Internet’s innovation, the elements of a 
  global telecommunications network and the Internet that should be 
  considered in the new treaty, as well as the role of transparency with 
  governments, the private sector and civil society in support of multi-
  stakeholder involvement.  Key conclusions were that the ITRs should be 
  high level, technology neutral principles based closely on the 1988 
  treaty text.

  Intellectual Property and capacity building were other strong thematic 
  areas. The Internet Society was responsible for two workshops relating 
  to intellectual property - one on Intellectual Property Enforcement 
  mechanisms, co-organized with the Center for Democracy and Technology 
  (CDT) and the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). Following the 
  IGF's mandate for true multi-stakeholder discussions, the panels 
  touched upon issues relating to intellectual property enforcement 
  mechanisms currently in place and their impact upon Internet 
  technologies and fundamental values. The idea of freedom - freedom of 
  expression, freedom of information and freedom of speech - was key in 
  all discussions about digital content as was the need for more 
  balanced intellectual property protection. Additionally, the dangers 
  of using Internet platforms to enforce intellectual property rights 
  was one of the issues that participants considered real with 
  discussions focusing on the lessons the Internet community should 
  learn from legislation such as SOPA, PIPA and ACTA. Finally, on the 
  issue of capacity building, the idea that we should consider capacity 
  building as referring to both the Internet technical infrastructure as 
  well as its social dimension, was heavily promoted by the workshop 
  participants.

  Enhanced Cooperation was another central piece of the debate. A pre-
  event co-organized by ISOC, ICC BASIS and APC enabled a frank and 
  constructive dialogue on enhanced cooperation in Internet Governance. 
  While ISOC and others favored the dialogue to go forward in the 
  framework of the IGF, others wanted to set up a dedicated working 
  group to discuss this issue. A complete report on this event will soon 
  be made available.

  Participants also discussed what is "the way forward” for the global 
  Internet community and for the IGF? We are also two years away from 
  the WSIS+10, the ten-year review of the World Summit on the 
  Information Society (WSIS), which of course will have implications for 
  the future of the IGF.

  The 2013 IGF meeting will be held in Bali (proposed dates are 21-25 
  October).

  V. World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)
  The 25th session of the Standing Committee on Copyright and Related 
  Rights (SCCR) at the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) 
  took place from November 19-23 in Geneva. Konstantinos Komaitis 
  participated and delivered a statement on the need for a Treaty on the 
  limitations and exceptions of Visually Impaired Persons/Persons with 
  Print Disabilities. The Internet Society was among the few 
  organizations who delivered a statement on the issue, stressing the 
  importance of accessibility for all and in particular for vulnerable 
  communities.

  VI. WSIS Forum
  The first preparatory meeting for the 2013 WSIS Forum was held in 
  Geneva on 30 November. Markus Kummer and Nicolas Seidler attended the 
  meeting. The WSIS Forum will be held on 13-17 May 2013 at the ITU. 
  Several segments will be dedicated to the WSIS+10 review process. A 
  Ministerial roundtable will be held on 14 May. The 2013 WTPF and 
  presumably also the IGF Open Consultations/MAG will be held during the
  same week as the WSIS Forum.

  1. RSE Report

  Update on Active Projects
  * RFC Format
    draft-rfc-format-flanagan-02.txt has been posted, capturing input 
    from the IETF 85 BoF, comments on the rfc-interest list, and 
    discussions with the RPC.  The next steps will include requesting 
    approval from the IAB for the publication of this I-D, writing up 
    the decision regarding RFC Format, and creating a work plan to 
    handle any necessary changes to the tools associated with RFC 
    production.

  * RFC Style Guide
    Work on the Style Guide has slowed down while most of the attention 
    is on coming to an informed decision on the RFC Format issue.  
    Efforts around the Style Guide will pick back up in January 2013.

  Other items of note:
  * RFC 6671 "Allocation of a Generic Associated Channel Type for ITU-T
    MPLS Transport Profile Operation, Maintenance, and Administration
    (MPLS-TP OAM)" was published.

### 3. IETF/IEEE 802


#### 3.1. IETF/IEEE Meeting at IETF 86


Dan Romascanu reported that the draft minutes of the 29 October 2012 teleconference between the IETF and IEEE 802 have been posted for review, and that the next teleconference is scheduled for 17 December 2012. Preparations are underway for a face-to-face meeting in Orlando following IETF 86 on Saturday, 16 March 2013, which will run from 8 AM to 5 PM.


Russ Housley is working with Glenn Parsons to schedule a presentation on the proposed IEEE 802 RAC OUI tier restructuring. Dan Romascanu is working with the IEEE 802.1 Working Group for a potential EDU session on the 802.1Q architecture, to be held at IETF 86.


#### 3.2. RFC 4441rev


Spencer Dawkins reported that work on draft-dawkins-iab-rfc4441rev is progressing, with more details being added on the IEEE 802 side. The document should be ready for IAB Call for Adoption in the near future.


#### 3.3. IEEE RAC OUI tiers proposal


Dave Thaler reported that he has exchanged email with Glenn Parsons about the proposed IEEE 802 RAC OUI tier restructuring and the potential impact on IETF protocols, and members of the IP Directorate are also responding. Ross Callon noted that this might be a useful topic for discussion in a Routing Area meeting, or potentially at an IETF plenary. Glenn previously presented the topic in the Internet Area meeting at IETF 84. The board agreed to discuss this topic further at a future meeting.


### 4. Global Standards Symposium (GSS)


Russ Housley reported he presented at the Global Standards Symposium in Dubai on 19 November 2012.

### 6. IETF 86 Plenary


The board agreed on “The end of POTS” as the technical topic for the IETF 86 plenary. Hannes Tschofenig agreed to coordinate the technical plenary from the IAB side.


### 7. Proposed Liaison to ISO


Russ Housley agreed to send updated text on the proposed liaison from from IAB and IESG to ISO/IEC JTC1/SC6 to the IAB-vote list for review, and a subsequent e-vote. The liaison will be approved by both the IAB and the IESG before it is sent.


### 8. Congestion Control Workshop Report


Hannes Tschofenig reported that work on the Congestion Control Workshop Report is nearing completion. The board agreed that Hannes would submit the next version of the report as draft-iab-cc-workshop.


### 9. Secure Call Origin


Alissa Cooper reported that she has drafted a memo on Secure Call Origin Authentication. The memo may be adapted into an IAB statement or document at some point in the future. Sally Wentworth of ISOC has expressed interest in the memo (now posted as draft-cooper-iab-secure-origin).


### 10. Program Membership refresh


Jari Arkko reported that Brian Carpenter will be stepping down from the IP Evolution Program, and asked the IAB to think about potential candidates to replace him.


### 11. Retreat Dates/Location


The board briefly discussed potential dates and locations for the 2013  

IAB Retreat. The IAOC retreat has been scheduled for May 7-8, 2013,  

with the location still TBD. Russ Housley noted that the amount of  

topics of joint relevance to the IAB and the IESG has increased  

recently, and it would be beneficial if the retreats could be  

scheduled so as to allow one day with a joint session between the  

IAB and the IESG. The IAB will discuss this topic further at a  

future meeting.


### 12. Document Status


Mary Barnes reported on the current status of IAB documents via email prior to the meeting.


#### 12.1. draft-iab-identifier-comparison


The IAB Last Call on draft-iab-identifier-comparison completed on 8 November 2012; two open issues remain.


#### 12.2. draft-iab-privacy-considerations


The IAB Last Call on draft-iab-privacy-considerations completed on 8 November 2012; nine open issues remain.


#### 12.3. draft-iab-dns-applications


The IETF Call for Comments on draft-iab-dns-applications closed on 16 August 2012, and an updated document was submitted on 22 October. Sixteen open issues remain in the tracker, including three sets of comments received during the IETF Call for Comments period.


#### 12.4. draft-iab-anycast-arch-implications


An updated version of draft-iab-anycast-arch-implications was submitted just before the meeting. Dave Thaler agreed to review the most recent version to see if his comments have been addressed; if so, the document should be ready for IAB Last call.


#### 12.5. draft-iab-dns-zone-codepoint-pples


The IETF Call for Comments on draft-iab-dns-zone-codepoint-pples closed on 30 September 2012. An updated version of the document will be posted shortly; however, the changes to the document are substantial enough that the document will need to go through IAB Last Call again after being posted..

There are currently 6 open issues on draft-iab-filtering-considerations that need to be addressed.


#### 12.7. draft-iab-modern-paradigm


The IETF Call for Comments on draft-iab-modern-paradigm completed on 1 November 2012. Russ has closed the four issues that were raised during the Call for Comments as “won’t fix”. The IAB will review the issues and next steps on this document at a future meeting.


#### 12.8. draft-tschofenig-smart-object-architecture


The IAB Call for Adoption on draft-tschofenig-smart-object-architecture completed on 8 November 2012. Four issues are currently open from the Call. The draft will be resubmitted as draft-iab-smart-object-architecture once the issues are closed.


#### 12.9. draft-rfc-format-flanagan

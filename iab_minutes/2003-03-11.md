### NOTES



#### 0. Rollcall, Agenda Bash and Previous Minutes



The Chair welcomed Barnard, Mark, Patrik and Itojun to the IAB.


The minutes of the [February 11, 2003 teleconference](/documents/minutes/minutes-2003/iab-minutes-2003-02-11/) were approved.



#### 1. Review of Action Items


([below](#actions))
#### 2. Review of Documents


([below](#documents))
#### 3. Liaison Reports



**IESG**  

The IESG is considering the formation of an addressing directorate as a means of improving the aspects of liaison with RIR activities. The IAB liaison to the IESG was working with the IESG in terms of assisting with providing the rationale for the IAB recommendations relating to the IPv6 address architecture appeal. The IESG is considering options relating to the sub-IP area activity.


**RFC Editor**  

The RFC Editor reported that the rfc editor web site was now configured with IPv6 access. This will be announced to the IETF at the IETF 56 plenary. An XML version of the rfc index has been drafted and is being circulated for review. There has been an effort to reduce the size of the publication queue.


**IRTF**  

The Searchable Internet Resource Names RG and the Anti-Spam RG have been set up. The Anti-Spam RG is operating in an open mode, and there is a significant level of activity on the RG mailer to date.


A draft of a Peer-to-Peer RG has received favourable comment, and it is anticipated that this RG will be formed in the near future.


Mobility will the be subject of a BOF at IETF56, and there will be further consideration of how to structure research into aspects of mobility into the IRTF.


An IAB review of the AAAARCH RG is to be held at IETF 56. A plenary session on the work of the Delay Tolerant Networking RG has been confirmed.


**ISOC**  

The potential use of the IAB research topics draft was being considered. An ISOC plan on the topic of initiatives for coordination of public funding of research activity will be presented for IAB information at the next IAB business meeting.


**ITU-T**  

No Report


**W3C**  

No Report


**ICANN**  

Mike St Johns has been named as the IETF member of the ICANN Nominations Committee. There has been no TLG activity to report.


**RSSAC**  

RSSAC has scheduled a meeting for the Sunday prior to the next IETF.


There has been some activity on documenting considerations of packet size and DNS capabilities.


**ISO**  

No report.



#### 4. Proposed agreement between IETF and JTC1/SC6 on IS-IS development



The IESG has considered the proposed agreement between ISOC/IETF and ISO/IEC JTC1/SC6 on IS-IS protocol development, and approves of the ISOC/IETF signing this agreement. The IETF Chair reported that the agreement has been approved in February by JTC1/SC6.The agreement has also been reviewed in the ISIS working group. The IESG has requested the IAB and ISOC to review the agreement and consider if they consent to the signing of this agreement at the San Francisco IETF.


The IAB consented to the signing of this agreement.



#### 5. Re-visit selection of ICANN Board liaison from the IETF



The IAB considered the current status of the relationship with ICANN and noted the potential role and agenda of the non-voting liaison. This will be considered further at the next IAB business meeting.



#### 6. Preliminary discussion of ISOC BoT appointment



The IAB noted some anomalies in the implementation of the nomination process and requested an apology be sent to one of the nominees in this respect. The confirmed nominees are Scott Bradner, Robert Hinden and Margret Wassman. An announcement will be posted to the IETF Announcement list. It was noted that the IAB should submit its selection to the IESG by 11 April 2003.



#### 7. Final planning for IETF 56



As determined at the previous IAB meeting, the IAB plans to meet on Tuesday morning for a regular IAB Business Meeting. The Tuesday evening is planned to consider technical topics.


The IAB will meet on Thursday morning to conduct a review of the AAAARCH RG ([http://www.irtf.org/charters/aaaarch.html](http://www.irtf.org/historical/aaaarch.html))


The IAB plenary agenda is planned as:


* IAB chair remarks

* NomCom Chair report
* Report on the Robert Elz appeal
* IRTF presentation: Delay Tolerant Networking Research Group
* Recent IAB documents:

#### 8. Other Business



8.1 **IAB NOMCOM WG input**

Sally Floyd, Vern Paxson, Ran Atkinson, Mike St Johns, John Crowcroft  

[Jul-02]  

*current*  

Status: Editing

	1. (current) Document the need for funding for further research for the Internet. This includes documenting important topics for research
	2. (next) The document under development covers the need for research in general and identifies specific areas of research. The drafting group feels that an additional document focusing on operational concerns is needed to support ISOC’s effort to guide governments seeking advice on funding efforts. One or both documents needs to discuss the concerns with how funded research should inter-relate with IETF work. In particular, including funding for individual researchers to attend the IETF, but recognizing that the IETF itself is not a candidate for direct funding. The new, operational document will have Geoff, Rob, and James as responsible parties for the IAB; other area experts may be recruited as needed.

#### 1.2. Administrivia


Cindy Morgan reminded the IAB that the tech chat on 28 February 2018 will start 30 minutes later than normal in order to accommodate the speaker’s schedule.


Cindy Morgan reported that the IETF has contracted with the Novotel in Paris for the IAB retreat, and that information about how to make hotel reservations will be available within the next couple of days.


### 2. Tech Chat: White Space in Colombia


Catalina Escobar and Andrea Londoño joined the IAB to discuss how white space has been used to bring broadband to rural coffee growers in Colombia.


There is a coffee bean that is only grown in the rural Mesetas region of Colombia. Lavazza, an Italian coffee company that is interested in this bean, partnered with several other organizations, including MAKAIA and ALO, to strengthen the capacity for social development in the Mestas region.


The project has three goals:


1. Increasing access and connectivity
2. Fostering ICT adoption and culture
3. Strengthening coffee growers through ICT tools.


So far, two schools and five coffee farms have been connected to the Internet using TV white space (512-518 MHz) in collaboration with Colombia’s National Spectrum Agency (ANE). The project took advantage of infrastructure that was already in place (towers, solar panels) in addition to buying new equipment.


The project was not designed to sustain access forever; designing a sustainability and scalability model will be one of the next steps.


Erik Nordmark asked how easy it was to get the spectrum regulators on board with this project. Catalina Escobar replied that it was easy because the regulators had been talking with their stakeholders about draft regulations, and the project was a way for them show that regulation is important.


Gabriel Montenegro observed that the participation from the private sector seems to have contributed to the project’s success, and asked if they think that using the value chains from a variety of organizations will help make the project more sustainable. Andrea Londoño replied that the participation from those in the private sector like Lavazza has been crucial, but that they they do not yet have a model that will give them sustainability.


### 3. Future Tech Plenaries


Brian Trammell reported the plans for the IETF 101 plenary are currently on track.

Privacy experts. The workshop is part of the AUC-ISOC project that will 
result in the development of Personal Data Protection & Privacy 
Guidelines for Africa.

IV. Highlights of Recent Activities

Jordan Internet for All Initiative Working Group - 7-8 February, Amman, 
Jordan
ISOC's Middle East Regional Bureau participated in the second round of

IoT in Canada. An Oversight Committee with representatives from the 
Internet Society's North America Regional Bureau, the Ministry of 
Innovation, Science, and Economic Development (ISED), and the Canadian 
Internet Registration Authority (CIRA) will oversee the process.  The 
Committee held its kickoff meeting on January 10th in Ottawa.  The next 
steps are to establish a website, conduct outreach to key stakeholders, 
and firm up logistics surrounding the first multistakeholder meeting, 
tentatively scheduled for mid-March.

#### 4.2. IRTF Chair Report

IRTF Report for February 2018

ANRP
The Applied Networking Research Prize selection process completed in 
January, with a little delay caused by this year's mean flu season.  Now 
in the capable hands of Mat Ford.  IRTF and ISOC publicize the winners 
meeting-by-meeting rather than all at once, but for the leadership the 
set of all the six winners plus the meetings at which they will present 
is provided below.  It is an exciting group and if there had been room 
for 10 winners, we had enough great candidates.

ANRW
The Applied Networking Research Workshop process is well under way, with 
a very strong Technical Program Committee (see: https://irtf.org/anrw/
2018/).  After good coordination discussions, the workshop will be held 
on the Monday (July 15) during the Montreal IETF. The reasoning was to 
entice academics and other non-regulars at IETF/IRTF to stay for WGs and 
RGs, and thus strengthen these applied research connections.  Current 
action items are for the steering committee to develop the budget and 
for IRTF Chair plus Steering Committee to firm up room and other 
arrangements with the Secretariat.


Status of Proposed and Potential Research Groups
​Proposed Path Aware Networking RG (PANRG) - third meeting will take 
place at IETF 101

Proposed Decentralized Internet Infrastructure RG (DINRG) - first 
official meeting is an interim on February 17, collocated with NDSS in 
San Diego.  Watch for streaming info.
Second meeting will be at IETF 101

Research group soon to propose:  Quantum Internet RG
Proposed chairs: Rod van Meter (Keio University), Stephanie Wehner 
(TUDelft)
Charter and community promotion under way, mailing list is qirg@irtf.org
One or both chairs will discuss of their ideas for the group in IRTFOPEN

​Actively recruiting a team for a Proposed Privacy Research Group, 
intended to research the application of privacy-enhancing cryptographic 
and other techniques into Internet protocols

IANA Services Liaison Report – 14 February 2018
 
SLA Deliverables Update:
- ICANN met 100% of processing goal times for the December 2017 monthly 
statistics report, exceeding the SLA goal to meet 90% of processing goal 
times.  These times include the steps that ICANN has control over and 
not time it is waiting on requesters, document authors or other experts.
 
- The annual review of processing protocol parameter related requests 
has been completed.  The confidential SOC2 report, prepared by 
Pricewaterhouse Coopers, has been provided to the IETF Leadership for 
its review.  There were no exceptions related to the delivery of the 
protocol parameters function.

#### 4.4. RFC Editor Liaison Report


–Begin RFC Editor Liaison Report, Heather Flanagan–



```
RFC Series Editor Update

- Format
xml2rfc v2.9.0 supports the initial preptool functionality required to
take a v3 draft and turn it into a fully expanded XML output. The RPC
will begin testing this after there is a v3 to TXT publication formatter
tool. From the release notes for xml2rfc:

This release introduces preptool functionality, through a --preptool
output mode.  With reservation for some points for which issues has
been raised, this follows the specification in RFC7998. The preptool
currently takes vocabulary v3 input, and produces prepped output.
When work on the text formatter commences, the idea is that the
input xml source will always be run through v2v3 conversion and
preptool processing before the output formatting, in order to increase
consistency and reduce complexity of the output formatter.

Work on other components of the new format tool chain are also underway. See
https://trac.tools.ietf.org/tools/ietfdb/wiki/FormatToolsPlan for the
current expected timeline.

- RFC 33
A report was submitted by Vint Cerf highlighting a transcription error,
introduced during the RFC Online project
(https://www.rfc-editor.org/old/rfc-online-2000.html), to RFC 33. RFC 33
was put online in April 2006. The error was identified (though not as a
transcription error) and recorded in the errata system in 2007 (see
https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/rfc33). The RSE, the RPC director, and
the RSOC discussed whether making a change to the online copy was an
appropriate action, and the consensus (not unanimous) was to leave this
recorded as an errata and not change the existing digital copy.

- IEEE (publisher)
The publishing side of the IEEE is building a reference center of
materials for product designers in the ICT space. They have requested
permission to include pointers to RFCs in this environment. While it has
been pointed out that permission is inherent for this kind of thing in
the TLP, they are planning to request an MoU expressly stating that they
have permission to link to our materials. If they go forward with this
request, the RSE will take this to the IETF Trust for review.


RPC update
See: https://www.rfc-editor.org/report-summary/

From the reports page:
Q1 2018 notes: As previously mentioned, the IESG has indicated that
there will be an increase in submissions over the next few months. The
increase in submissions we saw in Q4 2017 continues this quarter. A
large number of these documents are part of a cluster. 16 of the
submitted I-Ds thus far are part of a cluster; that’s 47%. Seven of
those documents are part of Cluster 336, which is currently an
eleven-document cluster.

### 2. Executive Session


The IAB convened an executive session to discuss the IESG Slate and IAB information needs for the confirmation process. At the meeting, the IAB concluded that there was insufficient information to confirm the candidates at this time. In particular, it was determined that making a decision now would be premature at best without first obtaining the nomineesâ€™ completed questionnaires (albeit, with potentially sensitive or questionable content redacted and indicated as such.)


In order to prevent future misunderstandings with respect to IAB information needs, an action was taken to create a wiki reference page for NomCom liaisons. In addition, Danny will provide to the NomCom Design Team a summary of the problems being experienced during this confirmation process as well as current ambiguities in RFC 3777 that have lead to the contention in the IAB confirmation step.


It was determined that the questionnaire feedback related to IETF liaison activity would be useful input. A request will be made to the NomCom to provide a summarized version of this feedback.


Eric Rescorla recused himself from the discussion of the APP AD nominee.

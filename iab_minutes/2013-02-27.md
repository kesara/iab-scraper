Internet Society Liaison Report to the IAB
27 February 2013

Topics:

I. WSIS+10 Review Meeting
II. WTPF
III. IETF Policy Fellows Program
IV. ITU-T SG2
V. ITU Council Working Group on Child Online Protection
VI. Messaging Anti-Abuse Working Group (MAAWG)
VII. Spam Project
VIII. Digital Content/Intellectual Property
IX. Council of Europe
X. Conference on Freedom of Expression online
XI. Conference on “E-Commerce, SMEs and Development: the perspectives
for and strategies of Latin American countries”

I. WSIS+10 Review Meeting
The Internet Society will be a key participant in the WSIS+10 Review
event, hosted by UNESCO on 25-27 February 2013 in Paris. This is the
first of a two-part review of the follow-up to the World Summit on the
Information Society, which will celebrate its 10 year anniversary in
2015. Sessions being organised by ISOC cover topics such as Internet
Governance principles, enhanced cooperation, cybersecurity, privacy,
human rights and intellectual property. ISOC Speaker Engagements & Event
Schedule at WSIS+10:
http://www.internetsociety.org/isoc-speaker-engagements-event-schedule-wsis-10

II. WTPF
The 4th draft of the Secretary General's report has been published and
was reviewed for the final time by the Informal group of Experts. The
WTPF is focusing squarely on Internet policy issues. Progress in
developing a new set of Opinions was made but the overall direction of
the debates is disappointing. In sum, the SG’s report still contains
inaccuracies and the tone is largely controversial, revisiting WSIS
debates, instead of building ground for consensus on a forward-looking
theme. ISOC comments and more info may be found here:
http://www.internetsociety.org/WTPF/2013.

III. IETF Policy Fellows Program
ISOC will host 11 policymakers at IETF Orlando - this is our largest
group so far. As we've done in the past, the group will participate in
some IETF sessions as well as both plenaries. We also have some small-
group discussions arranged to cover topics related to the DNS, routing,
interconnection and spam. For IETF 86, we are recruiting some IETF
participants to serve as mentors during specific IETF sessions in order
to provide clarification during the meeting and be another friendly face
for the group. A big thanks to the IAB and IESG - we've had very good
support and many volunteers from the community who are participating
throughout the week. For IETF 87 in Berlin, we will be hosting a group
from Francophone Africa and the European Union.

IV. ITU-T SG2
The ITU-T SG2 on Numbering, Naming, Addressing and Identification held
its first session in the new study period in Geneva on 22-31 January.
The group's new chair is Sherif Guinena, Egypt. Karen Mulberry
represented ISOC. New emphasis is being placed on misuse, requirements
for TSB allocation of resources, mobile identifiers and defining the
future of numbering e.g. M2M and the Internet of Things. In addition,
the SG created an Ad Hoc group to work on WTSA-12 Resolution 64 on IP
Address allocation to address concerns with current allocation and
assignment practices. The Ad Hoc will collect information and other
data on current mechanisms and present this at the September 2013 SG2
meeting where a determination will be made on what activity the SG will
undertake to address its mandate under Res.64. Bruno Ramos (Brazil) was
designated the Ad Hoc Chairman and will convene the interim
Correspondence Group.

V. ITU Council Working Group on Child Online Protection
ISOC participated in the ITU Council Working Group on Child Online
Protection on 1 February to introduce the participants to the Internet
Society paper, “Children and the Internet”. There was interest in what
we are doing to deal with this issue within our community and interest
in having ISOC present more information at the next meeting. Developing
countries expressed significant interest in obtaining benchmarking
technologies to assist in assessing effectiveness as well as obtaining a
high level policy and legal framework that they could use when preparing
domestic legislation.

VI. Messaging Anti-Abuse Working Group (MAAWG)
Messaging Anti-Abuse Working Group (MAAWG) met in San Francisco on 18-21
February to discuss best practices and other tools the industry is using
to mitigate spam, botnets and malware. Karen Mulberry attended the
meeting on behalf of ISOC. The focus of several of the sessions was on
the rise of threats to mobile devices as botnets and malware infections
are increasing and tool development will be key in establishing industry
practices. MAAWG has identified post-WCIT activities around spam and
their partnership with ISOC on this as a key initiative for the
organization this year.

VII. Spam Project
Work is underway to develop an initiative to address key issues that
rose out of WCIT ITR discussions in Dubai last year, the first area
being addressed is spam and its impacts in developing countries. A
project plan is being drafted by Karen Mulberry that covers both on the
ground workshops directed at regulators as well as videos and other
materials that both regulators and industry can use to establish their
roles and processes to better manage spam. Relationships with MAAWG and
other organizations as well as with ISOC member companies are being
developed as part of the program. The project will focus on Africa and
Latin America with a subset focused on the Caribbean. The draft project
plan will be completed by Public Policy early March and it will be
circulated to relevant stakeholders for comments and suggestions.

VIII. Digital Content/Intellectual Property
Konstantinos Komaitis attended the 'Licenses for Europe' working group
on user-generated content and licenses - an initiative promulgated by
the EU Commission. He presented and clarified the Internet Society's
position regarding inclusiveness and multistakeholder participation as
well as the need for balance and scope. Konstantinos is also developing
a paper on intellectual property and the rule of law. The paper seeks to
address and reflect some basic propositions relating to intellectual
property.

IX. Council of Europe
The Internet Society, represented by Christine Runnegar, participated in
the meeting of the Bureau of the Council of Europe Consultative
Committee of the Convention for the Protection of Individuals with
regard to automatic processing of personal data (T-PD-BUR) in
Strasbourg, 5-7 February 2013. The agenda included, among other things,
Medical Data, Employment Data, Data Protection and Police; Biometrics
and Bioethics. Meeting agenda and accompanying documents can be found

Abridged report: 
http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/dataprotection/TPD_documents/T_PD_BUR%282013%2929_Abr_En%20doc.pdf

X. Conference on Freedom of Expression online (15-16 February 2013,
Marrakesh)
Nicolas Seidler presented on the relationship between the Internet
architecture, its open model of standards development and the ability to
exercise freedom of expression online. This event was hosted by the ISOC
Morocco Chapter and the UNESCO office in Rabat.

XI. Conference on “E-Commerce, SMEs and Development: the perspectives
for and strategies of Latin American countries” (18-19 Feb. Geneva)
Konstantinos Komaitis and Nicolas Seidler addressed policymakers from
various Latin American countries, advocating for Open Standards and an
Open Internet for e-commerce.

1. RSE Report

Update on Active Projects
* RFC Format
draft-rfc-format-flanagan-02.txt is in IETF Call for Comments. The
comment period closes on 1 March 2013. There is still discussion
underway regarding the exact wording of the UTF-8 requirement, and
questions about pagination were very popular on the rfc-interest
mailing list in February.

* RFC Style Guide
The RPC and the RSE continue to collect items that must be included in
the Style Guide, but actual drafting of text is on hold until the
Format Requirements document is out of the draft stage.

Other items of note
* New Stream
The REFEDs group (http://www.refeds.org) is almost ready to submit a
draft requesting the creation of a new stream. They are working on
clarifying their own IPR policies, and as soon as that is done, their
request will be submitted formally. There is work to be done by the
RSE, the RSOC, and the IAB to determine exactly what the next steps
should be when this request is made.

### 5. Open IAB Positions


Bernard Aboba noted that there are several open IAB positions that will need to be filled at IETF 86, including:


* IANA Program Lead
* IP Evolution Program Lead
* ITU-T Coordination Program Chair
* IAB liaison to RSOC (one of two)
* Internet Coordination liaison
* OpenStand liaison
* IAB liaison to nomcom


#### 5.1. IAOC Liaison


Bernard Aboba reported that after talking with Bob Hinden, rather than nominating a generic liaison to the IAOC, it would be better for IAB members to participate in IAOC committees on an as-needed basis. Potential needs include the Tools Committee (e.g., to provide input on liaison and datatracker tool requirements), RPS Committee (to provide input on needs for remote participation), Budget Committee (to provide input on the RSOC and RFC Editor budget).


#### 5.2. OpenStand Liaison


Bernard Aboba reported that there will be an OpenStand meeting on 15 March 2013, and that it would be good to have one person from the IAB in attendance, in addition to the IETF and IAB chairs. The board agreed to defer appointing a liaison until after the IAB Chair for 2013-2014 is selected on Sunday, 10 March 2013.


#### 5.3. IANA Program Lead


Jari Arkko is the current IANA Program Lead; he will be stepping down to take the position of IETF Chair. The board agreed to defer appointing a new Program Lead until after the IAB Chair for 2013-2014 is selected on Sunday, 10 March 2013.


#### 5.4. IP Evolution Program Lead


Jari Arkko is the current IP Evolution Program Lead; he will be stepping down to take the position of IETF Chair. The board agreed to defer appointing a new Program Lead until after the IAB Chair for 2013-2014 is selected on Sunday, 10 March 2013.


#### 5.5. ITU-T Coordination Program Lead


Ross Callon and Joel Halpern are the current ITU-T Coordination Program Leads, and Eliot Lear (as liaison manager to ITU-T) serves as Chair. Eliot will be stepping down as liaison manager to take his position as an IAB member. The Program will discuss suggestions for a new liaison manager to be appointed by the IAB.


#### 5.6. I\* CEO “second”


The board discussed whether it makes sense to appoint a single defined person to be the “second” at the I\* CEO meetings (in addition to the IAB Chair), and agreed that it would be better to choose the second person attending based on the agenda topics for the meeting in question.


### 6. IAB Time at IETF 86


Cindy Morgan will send a call for agenda items for the IAB Business Meetings at IETF 86. Mary Barnes noted that the Emergency Services and Privacy Programs have both scheduled Program meetings during IETF 86.


#### 6.1 IETF 86 Plenary Update


Mary Barnes reported the the board has received favorable feedback on the “End of POTS” wiki page [[http://trac.tools.ietf.org/group/iab/trac/wiki](http://trac.tools.ietf.org/group/iab/trac/wiki "End of POTS Wiki")], and that the community seems to appreciate having material on the plenary topic ahead of time.


Hannes Tschofenig reported that he is waiting for Henning Schulzrinne to send him the slides for his plenary presentation. Glenn Parsons has also not sent in his slides, though he did submit a draft.


#### 6.2 BOF Signups


Mary Barnes reminded board members to sign up for BOF coverage on the wiki. Dave Thaler noted that it would be helpful in the future if the signup page would include the sessions conflicting with each BOF.


### 7. ISOC Board of Trustees Appointment


Mary Barnes reported that three people have accepted nominations to date. Alissa Cooper, Ross Callon, Spencer Dawkins and Eliot Lear agreed to coordinate interviews with the nominees during IETF 86.


### 8. IETF Liaison to ICANN Board of Directors Appointment


The board agreed to actively recruit nominations for the IETF Liaison to the ICANN Board of Directors.


### 9. Retreat Dates/Location


The board agreed to hold the 2013 IAB retreat in Dublin, Ireland on 8-10 May 2013, with 8 May being a joint session with the IESG. Stephen Farrell is working to confirm meeting space at Trinity College. Mary Barnes checked hotel availability in the city during the retreat dates and confirmed that people won’t have trouble getting a room. The Secretariat will investigate a hotel block and will get back to the IESG and IAB.


### 10. I\* CEO Recap


The board discussed the I\* CEO meeting that was held last week in Singapore. The board agreed that the purpose of the I\* CEO meetings should be informational; work items should be delegated to the participating bodies.


The board agreed to look at the IAB goals for participating in the I\* CEO meetings and look for ways to drive those goals on future agendas.


### 11. IAB Chair Selection Update


Mary Barnes reported that there are two candidates for the IAB Chair position; the discussion will take place over the chair-vote mailing list, and the final selection will be made at IETF 86 on Sunday, 10 March 2013.


The board agreed that non-voting ex officio members should be included in the discussion.


### 12. IAB Program Update


Bernard Aboba asked Program Leads to send him their status updates for inclusion in the IETF 86 IAB Report by close of business on Thursday, 28 February 2013.


Spencer Dawkins, as lead for the Liaison Oversight Program, noted that with the IAB changeover, several liaison relationships will need new IAB shepherds. Spencer asked the board to look at the list of existing liaison relationships and consider any they might be able to shepherd.


### 13. draft-ietf-behave-nat64-discovery-heuristic


The board agreed that the following note should be added to the IANA considerations section for draft-ietf-behave-nat64-discovery-heuristic:


IAB Statement regarding this .arpa request:


With the publication of this document, the IAB approves of the  

addition of “ipv4only” to the .arpa domain. Under RFC3172, IAB is  

requesting IANA to assign ipv4only.arpa as written in this  

specification. However, IAB does not take any architectural or  

technical position about this specification.

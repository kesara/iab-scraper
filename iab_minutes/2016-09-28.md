#### 2.3. RFC Editor Liaison Report

RFC Series Editor

- Format update
The various format drafts are actively being edited by the RPC. The RSE
has asked that these documents be treated as a document cluster so that
terminology and style are consistent within and between each doc. A link
to the cluster is here: https://www.rfc-editor.org/cluster_info.php?cid=C294

The RFP for the format tools was approved to go out to bid by the IAOC
earlier this month (September); the RFP is expected to be posted within
the next week. The RFP for the CSS formally closed on September 9; the
Tools Management Committee is discussing the response received.

- Digital Signatures for RFCs
After a series of useful calls with the RPC, and discussions online with
the RSOC and Russ Housley, the RSE has the action item to further update
the proposed operating procedures. The procedures document is expected
to be out for another review by the RSOC and the RPC within the next two
weeks.

- W3C Digital Publishing Interest Group
The RSE will be attending the W3C TPAC in Lisbon as an Invited Expert
within the Digital Publishing Interest Group (https://www.w3.org/dpub/).
The goal of this group is:

"The goal of the W3C Digital Publishing Activity is help make the Web a
platform for the digital publishing industry, and to build the necessary
bridges between the developers of the Open Web Platform and the
publishing industry."

This group recently published a First Public Working Draft of the
"Portable Web Publications Use Cases and Requirements"
(https://www.w3.org/TR/pwp-ucr/), for which the RSE was the main editor.


RPC Update
- SLA
See: https://www.rfc-editor.org/report-summary/
There have been a significant number of pages submitted so far in Q3,
342 of which are the v3 documentation.  A couple of editors are
currently processing the format-related documents.  We expect these to
move AUTH48 within the next few weeks.

Stats & Metrics: The RPC has deployed the code John Levine provided per
the RFC Editor’s Statistics and Reporting project.  The current code
uses a more accurate algorithm for counting PGTE (pages to EDIT); this
change results in the RPC having missed the SLA for Q1 2016.  Note that,
previously, the RPC’s stats machinery was focused on monthly document
counts; PGTE was informative and was not part of the SLA equation.

See https://www.rfc-editor.org/report-summary/

Digital Signatures: The RPC is reviewing the draft operating procedures
the RSE sent regarding the digital signatures process. The team is also
discussing how this impacts the publication process.

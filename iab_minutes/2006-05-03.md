### 2. Review of Specific Actions


IAB agreed that new liaisons will be announced to working group chairs and IETF as soon as the liaison is confirmed.


(See [Appendix A](#a))


### 3. Review of Specific Documents


#### Multiple Encapsulations


Bernard created a first version of a document on architectural implications of multiple link layer encapsulations. While this is prompted by the current use of multiple convergence sublayers in 802.16 there are several examples of this in the past. The IAB agreed that since the IETF is considering taking up work on IP over 802.16 this document is timely now and has potential future use, so work on this should continue.


#### Link Indications


Bernard solicited further review of the link layer indications document especially with the review of comments with respect to cellular type networks. Elwyn, Kevin, and Phil agreed to provide further input.


#### IP Configuration


Leslie reported that Jonathan can not complete this document, so she asked folks to think about volunteering to pick it up. The IAB agreed that the document is still valuable.


(See [Appendix B](#b))


### 4. Regular Reports


Nothing to report.


### 5. Liaisons


The IAB agreed to appoint Mark Nottingham as the liaison to W3C. The IAB agreed to send Scott Bradner to the GSC-11 meeting.


### 6. RFC Editor RFP Process


The IAB discussed the steps necessary to complete its obligations for supporting the RFC Editor RFP process.


### 7. Any Other Busines


None identified.


### 8. Dean Anderson Appeal


The IAB entered into an executive session and considered the appeal.

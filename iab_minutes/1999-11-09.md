### NOTES:


#### 1. Serious cleanup of IAB action list

(0bjective: leave a clean slate after the March meeting)


 Lots of items updated or deleted. 


#### 2. BOF coverage for Wed-Fri

(Don’t forget to copy the IESG on your BOF reports–with the good faith assumption that the IESG will copy the IAB on BOF charters in future.)


#### 3. Prepare for open IAB and plenary debate


#### 4. ICANN issues (especially the Ad Hoc Group)

Thanks to John Klensin for his success at constructively clarifying the Ad Hoc group’s role and charter.


 Discussion of potential candidates for IAB/IETF representatives to Ad Hoc group. 


#### 5. IAB and Nomcom issues

Brian Carpenter agreed to continue serving as IAB chair until Spring IETF meeting. At that time, whether or not he continues to serve on the IAB, he is determined to step down as chair.


#### 6. Simpson appeal #2

Consensus: Brian will read text of IAB finding at open plenary.


 Note that IAB rules do NOT require a hearing for an appeal; after due consideration the IAB has decided not to hold a hearing in this case. 


#### 7. Geoff’s QOS draft

The IAB enjoyed a spirited discussion of QOS in multi-provider networks. Geoff will update his draft and it will appear as an I-D in due course.

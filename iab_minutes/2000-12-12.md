### NOTES:


#### 1. review actions

see above


#### 2. review drafts in progress

see above


#### 3. administrivia

New meeting time: second Tuesday of the month, 3-5 PM US East Coast time.


#### 4. Bernstein appeal

Consensus achieved on wording of initial response.


#### 5. IAB administration, secretariat, and Exec Dir

One long-term possibility is that the IETF secretariat takes on this role. Still looking for near-term solution.


#### 6. PSO-PC membership and nominations

Nomcomm is willing to fill the PC seats, but not until after IAB and IESG nominations are settled.


#### 7. 3GPP liaison

Working with 3GPP appears to be an opportunity for us to do architecture in advance, rather than have to clean up messes after the fact.


 Internet draft has been posted outlining liaison between IETF and 3GPP. Time is short–review right away. 


#### 8. Internationalization workshop

Preliminary small-group meeting in New York resulted in several drafts. Will target a workshop between Spring and Summer IETF meetings.


#### 9. Middle-box workshop

Preference to leave on hold until after Spring IETF. Instead, hold a well-prepared BOF at next IETF.


#### 10. New “volume” area — sub-IP layers

Short version of what IESG is motivated by and trying to accomplish: 134 MPLS drafts, without any overall structure. Goal is to develop taxonomy in CCAM to define bins (e.g., restoration, talking to routing, measurement) for which broadly-applicable solutions may be developed.


 Some sound bites from discussion:  

 “At the very top level, the IETF is about making the Internet work. Controlling the sub-IP layers piecemeal has caused a nightmare; trying to do this in a coherent way is a good thing.”  

 “We have a dozen tunneling protocols. With hindsight, once upon a time someone should have defined a tunnel framework that could be customized in various ways.” 


#### 11. Discussion/ plan for Wednesday presentations

- RFC Editor Report
- ITU
- Highlights of recent IAB activities and documents–John Klensin
- QOS–Geoff Huston
- Firewalls–invite Ned Freed
- NAT–Tony Hain

#### 12. Review/ discussion of IETF processes

Almost 10 years since the IETF has seriously examined the way it operates. Issues identified by Brian:


 we are too slow  

 we lack focus  

 the IESG is too picky  

 the IESG is opaque  

 herding cats  

 the disconnect from the operators  

 money  

 IAB and IESG spend too much time on political sludge  

 IAB doesn’t do enough architecture
 Brian will circulate a note with a view to taking the discussion to POISSON in due course. 


#### 13. Technical Discussion

Review of current technical issues and hot topics — impact of wireless/IP convergence on applications and routing, BGP/routing crisis, middleboxes.

Internet Society Liaison Report to the IAB
12 Aug 2015

Topics:

I. WSIS+10 Review
II. IANA transition
III. IETF Policy Programme
IV. Fellowship to IETF 93
V. GAIA Working Group Presentation

I. WSIS+10 Review
The Internet Society has submitted a written contribution to the UN 
General Assembly WSIS+10 Review [1] to be held later in December, in New 
York. In our submission, we highlight the two main outcomes we are 
aiming for:
	• Preserving the consensus of the 2005 Tunis Agenda that 
recognizes the distributed model of governance of the Internet where 
each stakeholder group has its own role and set of responsibilities, 
while all working together;
	• Laying the foundations of an inclusive, people-centered and 
development-oriented Information Society for the next decade, 
articulated around three main pillars: 1/ collaborative networks for 
human empowerment and sustainable development,  2/ collaborative 
security for trust-worthy environments, and 3/ collaborative governance 
where open frameworks lead to successful discussions.

II. IANA transition
The Internet Society released a paper entitled “Perspectives on the IANA 
Stewardship Transition”. Through the paper, the Internet Society seeks 
to provide some context for the criteria the NTIA will use to review and 
evaluate the IANA Stewardship Transition proposal once it is submitted 
by the IANA Coordination Group.

III. IETF Policy Programme
The IETF Policy Programme had another successful outing at the IETF 93 
meeting in Prague. Fourteen policymakers from countries in Africa, 
Europe, North America and Latin America participated in the programme. 
Over four days, experts from the IETF community briefed participants on 
topics that included aspects of the Domain Name System, IP routing, 
Interconnection and traffic exchange, Security and Privacy protocols, as 
well as specific topics of interest identified by the group.  The IETF 
Policymakers Programme was started in 2012 to introduce policymakers 
from developing countries to the IETF standards making environment and 
to foster dialogue and information exchange with IETF leadership, 
experts and engineers. Preparations are currently underway for the 
programme at the IETF 94 meeting in Yokohama, Japan.

Information on the IETF Policy Programme is available here: http://

ietf-and-ois-programmes/internet-society-fellowship-5

IV. Fellowship to IETF 93
The Global Engagement team brought another successful cohort of Fellows 
to the IETF. This fellowship round included 14 individuals from 10 
countries in Africa, Asia-Pacific, Latin America & the Caribbean, and 
Europe. The round also featured closer integration between the Fellows 
to the IETF, IETF Policy Programme, and CGI.br Fellows. The call for 
applications for the Fellowship to IETF 94 has closed, and final 
selections are currently in progress. We would also like to take this 
opportunity to thank IETF leaders Fred Baker, Olafur Gudmundsson, Alvaro 
Retana, Warren Kumari, Daniel King, and Philip Eardley for their 
contributions as mentors in the Fellowship programme.

V. GAIA Research Group Presentation
Niel Harper (ISOC) and Walter Pienciak (IEEE) presented to the GAIA 
research group on the ISOC-IEEE Open Wireless Project. This is a joint 
initiative between ISOC and IEEE to develop interactive online learning 
materials on building wireless mesh networks. The online materials will 
be used in a ‘Train-the-Trainer’ model to build capabilities in rural 
and remote communities to design and deploy wireless community networks 
to increase access to the Internet. This initiative builds upon the 
award-winning Wireless for Communities (W4C) initiative that has been 
delivered by ISOC and the Digital Empowerment Foundation (DEF) in Asia-
Pacific.

Cross Community Working Group on Enhancing ICANN Accountability 2nd 
Draft Report (Work Stream 1)
https://www.icann.org/public-comments/ccwg-accountability-2015-08-03-en
Close date: 12 September 2015

II.  Upcoming topics that could be relevant
===========================================

Transition
----------

Cross Community Working Group on Enhancing ICANN Accountability (CCWG)

The CCWG held an interim meeting in Paris on the week before the IETF 
meeting. The meeting was deemed very successful and the CCWG was able to 
push forward their proposal. Now, the CCWG has published the second 
draft of its proposal. This CCWG proposal is not directly related to 
IANA, but it is about ICANN the organisation in the light of the IANA 
stewardship transition away from the US Government. There have been two 
webinars conducted about the proposal in early August. The slides, 
recordings and transcripts can be found at 
https://community.icann.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=54692681

The proposal tries to address a number of items. These items are split 
into two phases (Work stream 1 and 2). The Work Stream 1 is supposed to 
be ready during the IANA stewardship transition and the work stream 2 
will take longer. In the work stream 1, there are four building blocks 
that need to be in place in the time of the IANA stewardship transition. 
The building blocks are the following. 

* Principles (i.e. the Constitution) – The Principles guarantee the 
Mission, commitments and core values of ICANN through the Bylaws.
* Empowered Community (i.e. the People and its Powers) – The Community 
refers to Supporting Organizations and Advisory Committees, which can 
jointly take action should ICANN breach the Principles.
* ICANN Board of Directors (i.e. the executive) – The ICANN Board is 
responsible fordirecting ICANN’s affairs and is held accountable to the 
community through the community’s powers.
* Independent Appeals and Review Mechanisms (i.e. the judiciary) – The 
appeals mechanisms confer the power to review and provide redress, as 
needed and the reformed Independent Review Panel that is more accessible 
and at lower cost, with a 7-member standing panel that serves and an 
independent judiciary and whose decisions are binding on ICANN. 

The proposal is relatively large body of work and has many details (180 
pages). You can find the report at https://www.icann.org/en/system/
files/files/ccwg-draft-2-proposal-work-stream-1-recs-03aug15-en.pdf


III.  (If relevant) upcoming meeting topics of importance
=========================================================

ICANN board will hold a retreat between 26th-28th September, 2015.
Next ICANN meeting is 18th-22nd October, 2015.

2.5. IANA Liaison Report

IANA Liaison Report - 12 August 2015

2014 SLA Deliverables Update:

- ICANN met 100% of processing goal times for the June 2015 monthly 
statistics, exceeding the SLA goal to meet 90% of processing goal times.  
These times include the steps that the IANA Department has control over 
and not time it is waiting on requesters, document authors or other 
experts.

- The external third-party auditors have begun the annual audit process 
for the IANA functions.  Part of this audit fulfills the deliverable in 
the IETF SLA for a review of processing protocol parameter requests.  

Other News:

- In addition to the booklet describing the IANA functions mentioned in 
last month’s update, informational videos based on presentations given 
at the ICANN 51 and 52 meetings were recently published.  
See: http://www.iana.org/about
 
- ICANN’s Annual Customer Satisfaction survey will begin in late August.

#### 2.6. RFC Editor Liaison Report


–Begin RFC Editor Liaison Report, Heather Flanagan–



```
RSE Update
* Format project
draft-iab-xml2rfcv2 is out for community comment. So far, no comments
have been received. The comment period closes 2 September 2015.

For the various v3-related drafts, the focus right now is on drafting
the correct language to indicate these versions of the documents
neither require nor expect backwards compatibility, and on finding a
CSS person to help move that draft towards a more publishable state.
Since the drafts must go through as a bundle, getting that draft, the
weakest of the set, ready is the next major item to accomplish.

* The Operator community and the RFC Series
The RSE and the ISE held informal conversations with the Global BCOP
(Best Common Operating Practices) group during IETF 93. The goal is
still to send some of their documents through the Independent
Submission Stream. Of particular interest, the NANOG organization has
divorced itself from any formal document publication; the BCOPs
previously produced out of that group are searching for a different
organization to host and manage the material.

* RFC Production Center RFP
The RFP process is progressing according to schedule. The RFP was posted
on 15 June 2015, and the Q&A period was open through 8 July 2015. The
closing date for accepting RFP responses was 3 August; the vendor
selection committee will meet and discuss the responses over the next
two weeks. The contract is expected to be awarded no later than
October 2015.


RPC Update
* Stats - http://www.rfc-editor.org/reports/
The SLA was not met for July 2015. From the reports page:
"Typically, the rate of input to the queue(i.e., documents moved to
EDIT) decreases following the Q1 burst; however, we have not seen the
usual dip which means processing continues to be impacted.

* The RPC is currently working with legal@ietf on two authentication
requests. This will bring the subpoena count as it impacts the RFC
Editor up to four so far this year.

Heather Flanagan noted that she has not yet seen any comments on draft-iab-xml2rfcv2 on the rfc-interest list. Andrew Sullivan replied that he received one comment supporting the document, but that it was sent directly to the IAB Chair. He noted that the filters on the rfc-interest list prevent non-subscribed addresses from posting to the list. Robert Sparks asked if those messages were put into a moderation queue, or if they were discarded. Heather replied that she was not sure; she will check with the list moderators. Several IAB members recommended that such messages be put into a moderation queue rather than be discarded.


### 3. i1b.org


Cindy Morgan reported that the final change of i1b.org from Dreamhost to an IETF server managed by AMS is scheduled for Tuesday, 18 August 2015. She will send an email to the IAB before the change, asking people to refrain from updating the internal wiki for a brief period so that no data is lost during the transition. Passwords and mediawiki accounts should remain intact, but users have to be re- subscribed to the mailing lists.


### 4. IETF 94 Plenary


The IAB re-confirmed their support for having a joint plenary with the IESG at IETF 94. Jari Arkko asked Cindy Morgan to add an item to the next day’s informal IESG telechat on the same topic. Cindy Morgan will also send an email to the IAB and IESG to discuss the timing of the agenda.


The IAB briefly discussed potential technical topics for the plenary.


### 5. Comment on RFC 1984 to BCP


The IAB approved the text for a comment supporting the IESG changing RFC 1984 to a BCP. Andrew Sullivan will send that comment in as a response to the Last Call.


### 6. IANA Transition


The IAB discussed the current state of the IANA transition in an executive session.

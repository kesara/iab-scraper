### 1. ICANN user policies comments


The board reviewed the comments submitted on the ICANN User Policies [<http://forum.icann.org/lists/comments-iana-policies-user-instructions-25jun13/>] and agreed that there was nothing requiring an IAB response at this time.


### 2. ICANN RSSAC liaison


Lars-Johan Liman, co-chair of RSSAC [[http://www.icann.org/en/groups/rssac](https://www.icann.org/en/groups/rssac)], reported that RSSAC is in the process of being reorganized. RFC 2870, “Root Name Server Operational Requirements,” is also in the process of being updated. Russ Housley noted that the agreement was that the IETF BCP would focus on protocol issues, and that RSSAC would focus on operational issues. Russ Housley asked why the operational controls should be removed from the BCP if RSSAC is unsure that RSSAC has a way to publish them in a manner the root server operators will follow. Lars-Johan Liman replied that it is difficult for RSSAC to generate advice that is uncomfortable for the root server operators because they are heavily involved. That said, RSSAC generates advice, not instructions.


Peter Koch noted that in the reorganized RSSAC, root server operators will have a vital role. Suzanne Woolf said that as the restructuring continues, it would be helpful to have IAB input on some of the documents. Lars-Johan Liman added that while the membership of the RSSAC is currently up in the air, he envisions the IETF liaison as a non-voting member of the RSSAC Executive Committee.


### 3. ICANN Panels


Jonne Soininen reported that the ICANN CEO announced the formation of five new strategy panels during the ICANN meeting in Durban [[http://www.icann.org/en/news/announcements/announcement-15jul13-en.htm](https://www.icann.org/en/news/announcements/announcement-15jul13-en.htm)]. The panels are intended to give input into ICANN’s strategy. The IAB members were invited to suggest names for these panels in personal title.

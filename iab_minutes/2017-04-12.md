II. Internet Society: Tech Fellows to IETF 10 Year Review
Toral Cowieson presented a 10-year review of the Internet Society “Tech 
Fellows to IETF” program to the IESG during IETF 98 in Chicago. This was 
to inform the IESG of the program history, outcomes, and next steps. A 
request is now out to the IESG to see if there is follow-up interest for 
an IESG member to participate on the program selection committee or the 
small design team to refine the process and strengthen the program 
outcomes.

III. RightsCon 2017
At Rightscon 2017, ISOC advocated reducing government-mandated Internet 
access restrictions, in particular Internet shutdowns and Internet 
content blocking. ISOC announced it had joined the Keep It On [2] 
campaign and released a new paper on Internet Content Blocking [3]. ISOC 
also organized a session on Internet Futures, stimulating the project 
with community input on the impact of future Internet developments on 
online freedoms and rights.

#### 2.2. IRTF Chair Report

```
RG News:

Seven of the current ten RGs met at IETF 98.  The RGs are using remote 
presentation very successfully now, and as we discussed, the T2TRG's 
small group experiment looked very productive.

Of those groups, NFVRG had a problematic agenda (inducing all in the 
room including the chairs to read email), and they are on notice that 
they will have only 1 hour at IETF99, and that it had best have focus.

Thank you to the IAB for the RG review of ICNRG - the RG chairs have 
asked that we not schedule them for plenary presentation in the near 
future, but they are interested in having an open tutorial session to 
extend awareness of their work at the next IETF.

The groups that didn't meet at IETF98 were CFRG, NWCRG, and GAIA.

CFRG is holding a short interim meeting collocated with Eurocrypt 2017 
in Paris, April 30.  It is free to attend without attending Eurocrypt.

NWCRG is regrouping due to focus problems similar to NFVRG - will update 
in future on this.

Mat Ford has stepped away from co-chairing GAIA, and we have a new co-
chair, also from ISOC, Jane Coffin.  

Other News:

ANRW final submission deadline is 4/13 (it was extended).

#### 2.3. IANA Liaison Report


–Begin IANA Liaison Report, Michelle Cotton–



```
IANA Services Liaison Report – 12 April 2017
 
SLA Deliverables Update:
- ICANN met 100% and 99% of processing goal times respectively for the 
  January 2017 and February 2017 monthly statistics report, exceeding 
  the SLA goal to meet 90% of processing goal times.  These times
  include the steps that ICANN has control over and not time it is 
  waiting on requesters, document authors or other experts.
 
- The annual review of processing protocol parameter related requests 
  has been completed.  The confidential SOC2 report, prepared by 
  Pricewaterhouse Cooper, was provided to the IETF Leadership.  The IETF 
  Leadership has prepared a statement of its review of the report for 
  posting on the IAOC website.  
 
- The 2017 Service Level Agreement between the IETF and ICANN has been 
  approved by the IAOC and has been signed by the relevant parties.
  
Other News:
 
- The FY19 budget planning process has begun and in the next month we 
  will be reaching out to our formal contacts within the IETF to collect 
  input on service enhancements and other potential deliverables.
 
- The Chicago IETF meeting was very productive.  Many IETF participants 
  visited the IANA Services office hours desk to discuss requests in 
  their Internet-Drafts.  We continue to see more inquiries from authors 
  when preparing their documents to make sure the IANA Considerations 
  section has clear instructions instead of waiting until IETF Last 
  Call.
 
  IANA Services Operator and IETF Leadership Meeting Minutes:
 
  An informal meeting was held at the Chicago IETF meeting.  Meeting 
  minutes will be reported at the next IAB Business Meeting.

#### 2.4. RFC Editor Liaison Report

RFC Series Editor Update



```
- Format
A wiki that tracks, at a high level, the efforts to develop the new
format tools is now available:

https://trac.tools.ietf.org/tools/ietfdb/wiki/FormatToolsPlan

So far, everything is progressing as expected. A number of tickets have
been submitted against various drafts in the RFC Format github
repository (https://github.com/rfc-format) that are in the process of
being reviewed to determine what items will result in potential code
changes as the developers work on the tools.

- Style Guide
A -00 draft has been posted
(https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-flanagan-7322bis/) and was
discussed with various groups, including the RSAG, the RSOC, and the
Independent Submissions Editorial Board, during IETF 98. No significant
concerns with the additions the style guide were raised; there was
significant support for the change to add stream information in the
references for RFCs.

RPC Update
- SLA was met at Tier 2
See: https://www.rfc-editor.org/report-summary/
From the SLA report:
"Q1 2017: We experienced the typical Q1 surge in document submissions
associated with the March changeover in the IESG. The RPC published the
largest number of pages in a given quarter within the last two years.

Authors have been highly responsive, allowing a number of documents to
progress out of AUTH48 and AUTH48-DONE. This allowed a number of
documents to clear the last AUTH48 hurdles and be announced as RFCs.

The editors dealt with a complicated AUTH48 for portions of Cluster 238,
as reference chains were not strictly dependent on normative references,
but informative also (per author request). So far this year, 36% of the
published RFCs have been part of a cluster."

- RFCs and Non-ASCII Characters
The RPC is using the opportunity presented by
draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc5987bis, a document approved by the IESG and
currently in the RFC Editor queue, to work through identifying what
issues exist at the operating system level with regards to editing
documents with non-ASCII characters. Identifying the changes needed at
the OS level can happen independently of any new format tools being
available.

- IETF98 wrap-up
The RPC team enjoyed meeting with the community.  Some were first- or
second-time attendees that now have a better understanding of who/what
they are working for.  There was a steady flow of visitors during office
hours throughout the week.

The group took advantage of the face-to-face time to get a better
understanding of how GitHub works, given the level of interest in the
community to use GitHub (or something like it) as a tool. Paul Hoffman
graciously agreed to provide an overview for the RPC team.

### 3. Future Tech Plenaries


Allison Mankin reported that the Plenary Planning Program is planning a topic on GAIA for IETF 99, with one speaker confirmed. Mat Ford suggested a possible additional speaker; Allison will follow up on the Program mailing list.


### 4. IAB Comments on Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) Implementation Guidelines


Suzanne Woolf sent proposed text for the IAB comments on the IDN Implementation Guidelines out to the IAB list; discussions will continue on the list. The deadline to submit comments is 2 May 2017.


Ted Hardie asked if anyone else had already submitted comments. Suzanne Woolf will find out and report back to the IAB.


### 5. 2017 Retreat


The IAB agreed to run the IAB retreat from 1030-1930 Montreal time to allow Mark Nottingham to participate in some of the discussions remotely. Alissa Cooper will check with the IESG to see if they are willing to run the joint IAB/IESG day on the same schedule.


#### 5.1. IAB-only time


The IAB discussed several potential topics for the retreat agenda. Those who made proposals will write up a brief description of their topic to help scope the discussions and send it to the IAB by 19 April 2017.


#### 5.2. Joint time with IESG


Robert Sparks suggested that the IAB and IESG discuss BOFs versus side meetings, noting that the IESG already has this topic listed for the IESG-only portion of the retreat.


Robert Sparks asked if another session about the relationships between IAB Programs, Working Groups, and Research Groups would be helpful. Gabriel Montenegro suggested that adding Directorates to that list might be useful.


### 6. MSP Standardization liaison relationship


Gabriel Montenegro tentatively agreed to be the liaison shepherd for the Multi Stake Holder Platform on ICT Standardization. The IAB will confirm this either by email or at the next IAB business meeting.


### 7. Workshop at WSIS Forum


Alissa Cooper reported that she has been invited to speak at a workshop being organized by Article 19 at the upcoming WSIS Forum. Alissa will not be able to attend, but the organizers expressed an interest in having someone else from the IETF leadership speak instead. Ted Hardie will take over from Alissa as the point of contact on this, and the IAB will discuss it further to try to find the right speaker.


### 8. ETSI 5G Summit Report


Jari Arkko reported that he and Jeff Tantsura attended the recent [ETSI Summit on 5G Network Infrastructure](http://www.etsi.org/news-events/%20events/1148-etsi-summit-on-5g-network-infrastructure). The 3GPP’s work on 5G is getting more concrete; Jari has a call next week with one of the 3GPP’s chairs to discuss the current state of the work. Jari will report back to the IAB after that meeting.

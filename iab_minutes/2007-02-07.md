#### Approval of Minutes


Approved minutes of January 24 business meetings.


### 2. Discussion of IESG Confirmation


See executive session.


### 3. IETF 68 Planning


The IAB discussed the possibility of internationalization as a topic of the technical plenary on Thursday. Leslie agreed to put together a proposed structure for the meeting and approach possible speakers.


The IAB discussed a possible agenda for the breakfast meetings during IETF.


### 4. Liaison Appointments


The IAB discussed how to handle the liaison statements sent from the OIF. The OIF wanted to make sure that their liaisons to the IETF are archived beyond their own archives. The IAB agreed to point out that such statements are permanently archived when they are posted to a working group mailing list.


### 5. ISOC BoT Nominees


The IAB has received several nominations and is still in the process of accepting more.


### 6. Wildcard Document


The IAB discussed whether to expand the scope of the document beyond the original IAB statement in the SiteFinder response to include the kind of “response mangling” that is becoming popular in recursive resolvers. While this is not strictly a protocol violation (because it involves computation in the server), it does create incoherence in the network, when 2 different hosts get (very) different responses for the same query. Also, it gets in the way of DNSSEC. Agreement to include the expanded scope in the planned document.


### 7. Review of Specific Actions


 Nothing to report.


(See [Appendix A](#a))


### 8. Review of Documents


* authentication mechanisms
No update.
* untangling activeware (Lixia, Oran)
Postponed until March IETF. Will revisit when we have taken care of things that need to get done before the IAB turnover and will then revisit.
* link indications (Bernard)
Leslie to last call within the IAB and then to RFC Editor for publication. Community call for input already done.
* RFC series and RFC editor (Leslie)
Last call has ended; there are edits but no huge issues.
* IAB publications (Leslie)
Last call has ended; there are edits but no huge issues.


Also noted: Dave Thaler will join John Klensin as document editor on draft-klensin-rfc-independent in order to help speed completion of that document. He will do a rev to the document per the consensus points Olaf will summarize to the INDEPENDENT mailing list.
* Internet Transparency (Bernard)
Lixia and Phil will review the latest version to confirm it’s along the lines the IAB wanted, then Leslie to put out for community input
* RAW report (DMM)
Dave Meyer will work on a revision based on feedback; plans to get it to his co-authors by mid-week next week. IAB will try to get this revised and published before IETF 68 in Prague.


On the topic of following up with an IAB consensus contribution of “what’s happened since Amsterdam,” possibly at IESG’s ROAP BoF in Prague: no consensus of what this might be, let alone whether it could/should be presented in the ROAP bof as an IAB position. A separate topical call with implicated IAB and IESG members will be set up in the next week to discuss it further.


(See [Appendix B](#b))

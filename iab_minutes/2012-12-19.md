The board agreed to invite Sally Wentworth to an IAB meeting in January to discuss the outcomes from WCIT.


### 3. ITU-T Update


Eliot Lear provided the IAB with a brief update of the ITU-T WTSA meeting that took place prior to WCIT. Eliot highlighted several hot topics from the meeting:


1. A strategic review committee was chartered to, amongst other things, “identify ways and means to enhance cooperation with standard bodies with a view to minimize conflict of their standards with ITU-T standards.”
2. Russia proposed limiting external references, and encouraged incorporation of actual text, where external normative references must receive consensus to be included.
3. A new resolution to improve collaboration with other standards organizations was approved; however, the means for improving that collaboration have not yet been decided and will likely be a topic at future TSAG meetings.
4. An IPv6 test specification was listed as potential work item in SG11.
5. IPv4 address scarcity and monetization.


Eliot requested agenda time at an IAB meeting in January to further discuss more specific recommendations relating to IETF-ITU-T Coordination.

Internet Society Liaison Report to the IAB
18 December 2012

Topics:
  I. World IPv6 Launch network operator statistics
 II. Bandwidth management roundtable report published and promoted 
III. Council of Europe
 IV. W3C & W3C Privacy Internet Group (PING)
  V. Human Rights Day 2012 (10 December)
 VI. INET Qatar, 27 November
VII. Global Standards Symposium, 19 November
VIII. WTSA, 20-29 November
 IX. WCIT, 3-14 December

I. World IPv6 Launch network operator statistics
Updated IPv6 network operator stats have been published 
(http://www.worldipv6launch.org/measurements/) for November but owing to 
a change in the way one of the measurers processes their data the number 
of measureable operators has dropped from the previous month. Operators 
that remain measureable show increasing levels of IPv6 deployment.

II. Bandwidth Management roundtable report published and promoted
Building on an earlier briefing panel and associated report into the 
evolving landscape of Internet bandwidth, the Internet Society convened 
an invitational roundtable meeting of network operators, technologists, 
researchers and public policy experts with an interest in broadband 
regulation and deployment. This report documents the Internet Society 
Technology Roundtable meeting on the topic of bandwidth management that 
took place on October 11th and 12th 2012 in London, England: 
http://www.internetsociety.org/doc/bandwidth-management-internet-
society-technology-roundtable-series .

III. Council of Europe
The Internet Society  has been granted observer status in two of the 
Council’s Committees and participated actively in their work 
(Strasbourg, 27-30 November 2012). The Internet Society was warmly 
welcomed in both Committees and the contributions were received very 
positively by the delegates.

In the Steering Committee on Media and Information Society (CDMSI) ISOC 
was represented by Konstantinos Komaitis and Nicolas Seidler. This 
meeting provided the opportunity to present the ISOC position in various 
areas of Internet governance, especially those of digital content and 
human rights. Both Nicolas and Konstantinos promoted and emphasized the 
need for the Council to consider Internet technology standards as an 
additional guide to its mandate to promote governmental standards.

In the Consultative Committee of the Convention for the Protection of 
Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data 
(Convention No. 108), otherwise known as T-PD, the Internet Society was 
represented by Robin Wilton and Christine Runnegar. Robin and Christine 
joined the line-by-line work on the proposed revisions to Convention No. 
108, where they helped with both substance and form. Significantly, the 
T-PD finalized the revisions and agreed to transmit them to the 
Committee of Ministers. This is an important step forward in the 
modernization of Convention 108. During the plenary, they also gave an 
update on some of the Internet Society's recent privacy activities.   

IV. W3C & W3C Privacy Internet Group (PING)
Christine Runnegar participated in the W3C Do Not Track and Beyond 
workshop (26-27 November 2012). The purpose of the workshop was to 
discuss the W3C's next steps in the area of tracking protection and Web 
privacy. Christine and her W3C Privacy Interest Group (PING) co-chair, 
Tara Whalen, introduced and led a discussion on "How should we chart our 
future work for privacy, standards and the Web?". This included 
consideration of: what privacy guidance would be useful and to whom; how 
to approach privacy reviews of W3C standards; a proposal to develop a 
paper on fingerprinting, and; a proposal to develop Privacy 
Specification Assessment criteria for W3C standards.

This month's W3C PING teleconference was held on 6 December 2012. Of 
particular note was the report provided by Trent Adams (now at PayPal) 
regarding the follow-up he undertook on behalf of PING to help the 
chairs of the WebAppSec WG address privacy concerns regarding the draft 
Content Security Policy specification raised by a W3C participant. This 
is a concrete example of the value that PING provides to the development 
of W3C standards. PING has also been invited to conduct a privacy review 
of the Proximity API specification, and has started work on a document 
to describe fingerprinting and provide guidance to standards developers.

V. Human Rights Day 2012 (10 December)
The Internet Society celebrated  the international Human Rights Day 
which focused on inclusion and the right to participate in public life. 
The outputs, coordinated by Nicolas Seidler,  included a brand new ISOC 
webpage dedicated to this day <http://tinyurl.com/ck6hbrw>, a blog post 
reflecting on the relationship between the Internet and the right to 
participate <http://tinyurl.com/c2munme>, a press release 
<http:// tinyurl.com/bvhlqjw>, engagement with Chapters and with our broader 
community, as well as a Thunderclap campaign <http://tinyurl.com/ cnv3x9f> 
exceeding expectations (currently 133% of goal supported in 
less than three days).

The Internet Society also released a discussion paper that looks 
specifically at the fundamental protocols that make the Internet a 
success, its standards development processes and other key protocols, 
and how these align with the processes by which human rights standards 
are developed. Building on the core belief that the Internet's DNA 
enables fundamental rights such as freedom of expression, this paper 
draws parallels and differences that aim at fostering a dialogue between 
human rights activists, policy makers and the Internet technical 
community. Feedback and discussion on the paper's concepts will 
contribute to a further revision of the paper in 2013:

VI. INET Qatar, 27 November
The first INET organized by ISOC in the Gulf region was held in Doha, on 
27 November. The event gathered around 300 participants and was held at 
Carnegie Melon University Qatar. Constance Bommelaer was responsible for 
developing the partnership with the university and organized all the 
sessions. The discussions were well covered by the press; she was 
interviewed along with Dawit Bekele by the BBC and Doha News. Constance 
also put together a closed briefing session, on 28 November, on Internet 
Governance for ICT Qatar managers participating in the ITU WCIT 
conference.

VII. Global Standards Symposium, 19 November
Russ Housley, IETF Chair, participated on the Standards Collaboration 
panel which covered the collaboration between the ITU-T and other fora 
as well as provided a platform to present the OpenStand principles.  
Also attending were Leslie Daigle, Sally Wentworth, Karen Mulberry and 
Andrei Robachevsky. ISOC helped to arrange two bilateral meetings with 
the Heads of Delegation to WTSA from Japan and Korea that focussed on 
OpenStand and the IETF’s role in the standards environment. The outcome 
of each meeting was a very positive understanding of the value that IETF 
and the Internet technical community provide.

VIII. WTSA, 20-29 November
Participating at WTSA on the ISOC delegation were Sally Wentworth, Karen 
Mulberry, Leslie Daigle, Andrei Robachevsky and Eliot Lear.
·      ITU-T Y.2770, Requirements for Deep Packet Inspection in Next 
Generation Networks from SG13 was approved along with the two MPLS 
Recommendations from SG15.  The IETF confirmation of the code point 
assignment was acknowledged in closing Plenary.
·      Cybersecurity Resolution was revised. Security work will continue 
in the ITU-T; there are several references to working collaboratively 
with other groups with expertise.
·      Numbering Resolutions on misuse, alternative calling and calling 
line identification have been revised with a focus on VoIP fraud and 
leveraging misuse to capture settlements from IP networks.  In addition 
both SG2 and SG3 have been called upon to determine the role of a hub 
and the settlement process.
·      Spam was discussed extensively and there will be an ITU-T study 
conducted to capture data on volume, types, and features of spam to help 
identify routes, and sources to determine actions necessary to stop 
spam.
·      Internet Study Group - Resolution 178 on ITU role in organizing 
the work on technical aspects of telecommunication networks to support 
the Internet will become a Joint Coordination Activity (JCA) to 
facilitate work within the ITU-T as well as with other industry fora.  
However there is also still a possibility that the JCA will become a 
Working Party of TSAG.
·      The number of ITU-T Study Groups will remain at 10, with the 
creation of two new TSAG Advisory Committees one to focus on a T Sector 
strategic plan and the other will review and expedite new work projects.   
Several other groups will also continue into the new study period such 
as M2M, Cloud Computing, and SDN.

IX. WCIT, 3-14 December
Attending were Lynn St. Amour, Walda Roseman, Markus Kummer, Leslie 
Daigle, Sally Wentworth, Karen Mulberry, Mat Ford and Sebastian 
Bellagamba. Michuki Mwangi was also present as a member of the Kenyan 
delegation.  A summary of some of the key issues resulting from the two-
week long treaty conference is here:

#### 4.4. IRTF Chair


–Begin IRTF Chair Report, Lars Eggert–



```
- ANRP 2013 reviews are ongoing. 37 nominations were received.

- RG chairs are having issues using the IETF datatracker extensions for 
  chairs. Ticket has been filed in May 2012. No activity since.

- Folks are proposing a new RG on network coding. The discussion list is 
  at nwcrg@irtf.org. A wiki is at
  http://wiki.tools.ietf.org/group/irtf/trac/wiki/nwcrg. I'm somewhat 
  concerned that the text under "NWC Practical Application and 
  Standardization Path" is 5x the length of the text under "NWC 
  Research", but it's a first draft, I guess.

- The last document of the P2PRG just went to the RFC Editor, and the RG 
  will close after it has been published.

- The ICCRG mailing list has been migrated to irtf.org. It was the last 
  RG list not hosted by us.

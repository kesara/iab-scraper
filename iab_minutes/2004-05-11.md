### NOTES


0. #### Roll call, Agenda Bash and Previous Minutes


	 Minutes of the [13 April teleconference](/documents/minutes/minutes-2004/iab-minutes-2004-04-13/) were approved.
1. #### Review of Action Items


	([see below](#actions))
2. #### Review of Documents


	 ([see below](#documents))
3. ####  IAB Liaison Reports


	 **IESG**  
	
	*Rob Austein:*, *Bert Wijnen*: 
	
	
		+ IESG is discussing an experiment to do a “split-team” review of Informational and Experimental WG documents. The idea is that we form 2 teams (one AD from each area onm each team) and that we will have an I-D be reviewed by one team only. The goal of the experiment is to see if we can improve throughput without reducing quality of the review. It will be checked for clearance by the community.
		+ IESG has issued an IETF Last Call for draft-iesg-rfced- documents which is aimed at reducing the workload on IESG for individual submissions to the RFC-Editor. The proposal is that the IESG review will be limited to ONLY checking for conflicts between the work of the IETF and the document in question.
		+ Harald (and some other ADs) will undertake an IETF BOF at the next NANOG meeting**RFC Editor**  
	
	*Joyce Reynolds:* 
	
	
		+ The RFC Editor is adding source names (e.g., IETF Working Group name) to INDEX, rfc-index.txt, rfc-index.xml. This is currently waiting on an IESG check of mapping of RFC’s to Working Groups received from the IETF Secretariat.
		+ The RFC Editor is also adding draft names to to INDEX, rfc-index.txt, rfc-index.xml
		+ We are receiving weekly reports from Bill Fenner on mismatches between IESG datatracker and RFC-Editor queue
		+ We are planning for RFC-Editor’s ‘meet and greet’ kiosk at IETF-60
		+ The rfc-interest list is currently discussing representation of UTF-8, unicode in RFCs
		+ We are adding the historic Internet Engineering Notes (IENs) to INDEX, and the RFC Editor search engine
		+ We have clarified/updated rules for vetting errata on standards track documents. If the reported errata changes the meaning of the RFC, we will consult the appropriate ADs
		+ We are working on the initial launch of the RFC Editor’s Editorial Board **IRTF**  
	
	*Vern Paxson:* 
	
	
		+ Nothing to Report **ISOC**  
	
	 *Lynn St Amour:* 
	
	
		+ No report submitted this month, due to INET commitments.**Administrative Restructuring**  
	 *Leslie Daigle:* 
	
	
		+ See agenda item.
4. #### Updates from IETF Liaisons


	**ITU-T**  
	
	*Scott Bradner:*

	*Rob Austein:*
	
	
		+ No items reported **IEEE 802**  
	
	*Bernard Aboba:*
	
	
		+ Review of the IETF CAPWAP taxonomy document has been proceeding. A summary of comments has been compiled. Overall, IEEE 802.11 has found the document to be helpful.
		+ Bert Wijnen continues to work with Tony Jeffree on providing IEEE 802 with access to the “New Work” announcements.
		+ The Wireless Internetworking Study Group (WIEN) has been chartered by IEEE 802.11 and is looking into internetworking of 3G and WLAN technologies, including some of the issues relating to AAA and EAP Network Discovery that had been discussed in EAP WG at IETF 59. A brief summary of the IETF discussion will be presented there.
		+ IEEE 802.11 has requested that draft-walker-ieee802-req-00 be published as an Informational RFC. The document has gone to IETF last call, comments have been received and a vote on the proposed resolutions has been scheduled within IEEE 802.11 for May 14.
		+ In order to clarify the requested handling of EAP method documents, IEEE 802.11 has inserted a clause requesting that such documents be sent to IETF last call.

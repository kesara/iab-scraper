### 1. Potential Low Latency Services over WAN workshop


Linda Dunbar, Andy Malis, and Donald Eastlake presented a proposal for an IAB workshop on Low Latency Services over WAN.


Jari Arkko noted that there have been several recent statements about low latency:


* [Mission-critical 5G MTC requires low latency & high reliability and availability](https://www.ericsson.com/research-blog/5g/5g-radio-access-for-%20ultra-reliable-and-low-latency-communications/) (Ericsson)
* [Tactile Internet requires 1 ms reaction time](https://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-t/oth/23/01/%20T23010000230001PDFE.pdf) (ITU)
* [Self-driving cars require 1ms latency](http://www.huawei.com/minisite/5g/en/defining-5g.html) (Huawei)
* [5G should provide 10ms latency in the general case and 1ms in special cases, and instantaneous connection setup](http://www.slideshare.net/orlando-taddeo/ngmn-5g-initiative-white-%20paper) (NGMN)


There is evidence that the world cares about low-latency and that improvements are being made, but the work is not done.


After discussion, the IAB agreed that the topic needs to be refined further before they can approve holding a workshop. Jari Arkko and Brian Trammell took an action to further discuss this and report back to the IAB.


### 2. Followup on IPv6 Statement


The IAB discussed follow-up actions to the [IAB Statement on IPv6](https://www.iab.org/documents/correspondence-reports-documents/%202016-2/iab-statement-on-ipv6/). Lee Howard will propose a list of organizations that the statement should be sent to directly.

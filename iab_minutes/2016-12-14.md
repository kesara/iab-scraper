### 2. Tech Chat: Architectural Transition and Planning for Partial Deployment of a Future Internet Architecture


Adrian Perrig joined the IAB to talk about the SCION (Scalability, Control, and Isolation On Next-Generation Networks) Architecture. There is a belief that the Internet is immutable. Benefits are limited, especially for early adopters. The goal is to provide so many benefits, even for early adopters, such that one cannot turn back (e.g., the transition to smart phones).


SCION’s architectural design goals include:


* High availability, even for networks with malicious parties
* Secure entity authentication
* Flexible trust
* Transparent operation
* Balanced control among ISPs, senders, and receivers
* Scalability, efficiency, and flexibility


SCION’s Trust Root Configuration (TRC) is such that each isolation domain (ISD) defines a set of trust roots for different operations. The TRC file is used to bootstrap trust on a host. The TRC contains the policy for updating each PKI’s roots of trusts.


SCION is a complete re-design of the network architecture to resolve numerous fundamental problems, such as:


* BGP protocol convergence issues
* Separation of control and data planes
* Isolation of mutually untrusted control planes
* Path control by senders and receivers
* Simpler routers (no forwarding tables)
* Root of trust selectable by each ISD


SCION is an isolation architecture for the control plane, but a transparency architecture for the data plane.


Adrian Perrig said that SCION has a chance for adoption because it has tangible properties and improvements over the present Internet to drive adoption, such as:


1. Multipath communication
2. High availability, DDoS defense
3. Transparency and control over paths for senders
4. Strong security guarantees


Additionally, there is no global coordination required to adopt SCION, and there are no IPR constraints on adoption.


Jari Arkko asked if isolation domains might lead to Internet fragmentation, where there could be a different Internet in Switzerland versus China. Adrian Perrig replied that the isolation domains are expected to grow organically and overlap with each other. End users would be able to inspect the routes of trust.


Erik Nordmark asked what the scope of future work on SCION is. Adrian Perrig replied that the last six years have been spent on the basic architecture, but a lot of research is still needed on path construction beacon messages, and what information should be added to those.


Allison Mankin asked how much network measurement has been done during the SCION trials. Adrian Perrig replied that they are conducting real-world measurement right now.

II. IGF Connecting the Next Billion
III. Submission to consultation by UN Special Rapporteur
IV. Working Group on Enhanced Cooperation
V. International Institute of Communications
VI. M3AAWG/UCENet

I. ITU World Telecommunication Standardization Assembly 2016 (WTSA-16)
ITU WTSA-2016 concluded on November 3 with delegates from Member States
reaching consensus on the future structure and work program for ITU-T
for the 2017 – 2020 period. The key issues that dominated the conference
were the Digital Object Architecture (DOA), Internet services (referred
to as Over-The-Top, or OTT), the role of the Internet of Things, and
privacy and trust. Despite the tough negotiations throughout most of the
conference, a compromise agreement on these issues was achieved in the
end.

One of the main outcomes of WTSA-16 is the increased regulatory and
policy role for governments in Internet-related policy matters that came
as a result of changes to the mandates of ITU-T Study Group 2 (SG-2) on
naming, numbering, addressing and identification, and to Study Group 3
(SG-3) on accounting, charging, and tariffing principles. A new study
area on the operational impact of Internet services or infrastructure on
international telecommunication services and networks was approved for
SG-2, while SG-3 will conduct additional studies on the economics and
regulatory impacts in these same areas.

Outcomes of some of the key issues debated
------------------------------------------
Digital Object Architecture (DOA): WTSA-16 received ten resolutions
ranging from smart cities, combating counterfeit devices and
cybersecurity to e-health and IoT that explicitly and implicitly
referenced the DOA. Agreement was reached to either replace proposed DOA
references with Recommendation ITU-T X.1255 (which is based on the DOA)
or remove them entirely from the relevant resolutions if agreed text on
identity management would be reflected in the summary record of the
proceedings. The compromise text was as follows: “the Plenary recognized
that identity management plays an important role in many
telecommunications/ICT services and that it can be implemented using a
range of technologies and solutions.”

Spam was a contentious issue as past debates on spam regulation re-
emerged. The WTSA-16 proposal on Resolution 52 on Combating Spam sought
to expand SG-3’s mandate into spam-related activities. However, those
opposed made a strong case for dismissal by drawing attention to the
spam-related activities within SG-17 (Security) and in SG-2 of the ITU’s
Development Sector (ITU-D). Agreement was reached once the SG-3
reference was removed from the resolution.

Over-the-top Services (OTT): The economic impact of Internet services on
telecommunications providers was debated at length at WTSA-16, and was
tied to a proposal for a new OTT resolution. With the new study areas on
Internet services in SG-2 and SG-3, a compromise was reached and this
new OTT resolution was withdrawn.

Privacy and Trust: While Study Group 17 (SG-17) is the lead study group
for security in ITU-T, and its privacy focus is limited to personally
identifiable information, the new WTSA-16 proposal on IoT sought to
expand SG-20’s mandate related to privacy and trust. The definition of
privacy and scope of the issue dominated much of the discussions. The
potential for an ITU role in the privacy policy realm was the chief
concern among those opposed to this resolution. While those in support
pointed to ITU Plenipotentiary 2014 texts to validate the ITU’s role in
these areas, and cited the need for this work in SG-20 tied to big data
from IoT. The resolution was later withdrawn as a compromise could not
be reached.

Beyond WTSA-16
--------------
In our view WTSA-16 placed the institution on a glide path towards a
more expansive policy role in Internet-related matters. While consensus
was reached on some of the key issues outlined here, the discussions
will continue beyond WTSA-16 and into the Plenipotentiary (Plenipot)
conference in 2018 where we can expect governments will try to exert
increased regulatory jurisdiction over these matters. It will be
important to encourage ITU membership to continue to engage with
stakeholders on these Internet related matters.

II. IGF Connecting the Next Billion
The Internet Governance Forum (IGF) is currently investigating Policy
Options for Connecting and Enabling the Next Billion(s) of users online,
which is in its second phase this year. Outcomes from this work will be
presented at the 2016 IGF, 6-9 December, in Guadalajara. ISOC has
supported the effort with several submissions on access-related best
practices.

III. Submission to consultation by UN Special Rapporteur
The Internet Society has sent a submission to the call for contributions
by the UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression, to feed his 2017
report on the role of the telecommunications and Internet access sectors
regarding freedom of expression. We focused mostly on highlighting the
role of the IETF in relation to freedom of expression, both in the
dimension of its working processes as well as some of its outputs. More
information on the consultation is here: <http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ 
Issues/FreedomOpinion/Pages/Telecommunications.aspx>.

IV. Working Group on Enhanced Cooperation
Following the first meeting of the Working Group on Enhanced
Cooperation, and to inform the discussions of the second meeting, the WG
decided to invite all Internet stakeholders to share their thoughts on
two questions: What are the high level characteristics of enhanced
cooperation? Taking into consideration the work of the previous WGEC and
the Tunis Agenda, particularly paragraphs 69-71, what kind of
recommendations should we consider? ISOC supports a broad understanding
of “enhanced cooperation”, focused on cooperation and inclusiveness of
all stakeholders, which will inform our input to the consultation. The
deadline for input is December 7.

V. International Institute of Communications (11-13 October 2016)
The Internet Society participated in the IIC Communications Policy &
Regulation week, speaking in the closing panel on evolving priorities,
consumption patterns and attitudes to privacy, security and freedom of
expression. At the invitation of the Canadian Radio Television and
Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), the Internet Society also
presented in a workshop on eliminating spam and nuisance communications
for regulators, highlighting issues for emerging economies.

VI. M3AAWG/UCENet (24-27 October 2016)
The Internet Society participated in the combined 38th M3AAWG General
Meeting and UCENet (formerly, the London Action Plan) meeting. At the
invitation of the M3AAWG Pervasive Monitoring SIG chairs, the Internet
Society led a session on privacy and emerging issues.

VII. IXP Training & NOG Development
ISOC supported training in Papua New Guinea (PNG) in May on BGP for
IXPs, and continued development of the IX by sending a switch to the
team in PNG. ISOC and APNIC are cooperating to focus on continuity and
sustainability. Switches have also been sent to Gambia, Kenya, and
Nigeria to continue to help increase capacity at these IXPs.

VIII. RIPE Atlas Anchor Deployment
ISOC staff are working with RIPE NCC to deploy RIPE Atlas Anchors to 10
African IXPs by the end of 2017. The first RIPE Atlas Anchor went live
in Tanzania in September. We expect the Kenyan Anchor to be live by the
end of November. In continued coordination with RIPE NCC, we helped
sponsor the IXP Tools Hackathon during RIPE 73 – an article about the
results can be found here: <https://labs.ripe.net/Members/becha/ixp- 
tools-hackathon-results>.

IX. Community Networking/Wireless for Communities (W4C)
Over the last eight months, ISOC staff have been reaching out to and
bringing community networking experts together. The purpose of this
long-term effort is to support networks being developed, experts coming
together, and for best practices to be highlighted and developed in a
bottom-up community building effort. Community network grants have/are
being provided to groups in the Republic of Georgia, Colombia, and South
Africa to date with more to come before the end of 2017.

Internet Society Liaison Report to the IAB
13 December 2016

Topics:

I. Tech Fellowship to IETF 97
II. Women’s Forum Global Meeting 2016
III. ISOC-AUC Cybersecurity Project
IV. IETF Policy Fellows Program at IETF 97
V. Global Internet and Jurisdiction Conference 2016

I. Tech Fellowship to IETF 97
The Tech Fellows Program for IETF 97 Seoul was delivered successfully.
There were 12 Fellows from 10 countries, including Brazil, China,
Colombia, Ecuador, Ethiopia, Georgia, India, Tunisia, Uganda, and
Zimbabwe.

A number of fellows presented or participated in working groups or other
activities.
- Harish Chowdhary (India) presented in the dnsbundled BoF and
also in a Bar BoF on issues with deploying internationalized emails.
- Eduardo Morales (Brazil) collaborated with Lee Howard who provided
input into updating his IPv6 teaching materials for NIC.br.
- Tariq Saraj (Pakistan) was involved in in-depth discussions in the
dprive working group pertaining to including authoritative name
servers in future drafts. He also presented his thesis to the
working group chair.

The findings of our past participants survey has been delivered to ISOC
management and IETF leadership.

II. Women’s Forum Global Meeting 2016
The Women's Forum Global Meeting 2016 took place in Deauville, France
from 30 November - 2 December 2016. The theme of this year's meeting
was, "Is the sharing economy a sharing world?" The Internet Society led
a session on "Defending your digital self" (Session leaders were Nighat
Dad, Founder, Digital Rights Foundation and Christine Runnegar, Internet
Society.)

III. ISOC-AUC Cybersecurity Project
As part of a collaborative project to develop security guidelines
tailored for the African environment, the Internet Society and the
Commission of the African Union (AUC) held an expert workshop in
Nairobi, Kenya (28-29 November 2016) to review the draft Internet
Infrastructure Security Guidelines for Africa. Internet infrastructure
security experts from Africa and elsewhere participated in the workshop.
The experts provided valuable input on the specific opportunities and
challenges present in the African Internet ecosystem, and the security
recommendations.

The Internet Infrastructure Security Guidelines for Africa will
emphasize the importance of the multistakeholder model and collaborative
security in protecting Internet infrastructure. The guidelines will
recommend a number of important first steps towards securing Internet
infrastructure in Africa. These include engaging in new capacity
building initiatives, facilitating collaboration and coordination
through new and existing mechanisms, and specific baseline security
practices for Internet service providers. The guidelines will undergo
further review, before being launched in early 2017.

IV. IETF Policy Fellows Program at IETF 97
The IETF 97 Policy Fellows Program in Seoul welcomed 12 guests from
Brazil, Thailand, Vanuatu, Papa New Guinea and other countries. The
topics discussed covered a wide range, including Routing, DNS, IoT
security and trust. Government officials expressed their excitement and
interest in the work of the IETF and committed to taking this
information back to their capitals. Policy makers also became aware of
the need to do more outreach about the IETF and its importance and they
informed us that they will do so when they report back to their
superiors. As always, the Internet Society would like to thank the IAB
and the IETF community for their support in delivering the policy
fellows program.

V. Global Internet and Jurisdiction Conference 2016
The first Global Internet and Jurisdiction Conference of the
multistakeholder policy network Internet & Jurisdiction was held on
November 14-16 in Paris, France. It brought together over 200
stakeholders from more than 40 countries. For the first time on a global
level, senior representatives from governments, businesses, technical
operators, civil society, academia and international organizations
specifically addressed the future of jurisdiction on the cross-border
Internet. The conference was institutionally supported by the OECD, the
European Commission, UNESCO, the Council of Europe, the Slovak
Presidency of the Council of the European Union and ICANN.

The conference firmly placed the topic of jurisdiction on the Internet
governance agenda, as recommended in the 2014 NETmundial Roadmap for the
future evolution of the Internet governance ecosystem. Participants
collaborated to frame issues of common concern, to exchange views on
existing efforts to address them and discussed related operational
challenges. Stakeholders identified concrete areas for cooperation to
help the development of shared practices and frameworks for legal
interoperability and due process across borders.

#### 3.4. RFC Editor Liaison Report


–Begin RFC Editor Liaison Report, Heather Flanagan–



```
RFC Editor Liaison Report, October 2016

RFC Series Editor update
- Format update
The various format drafts are wrapping up their AUTH48 actions; the goal
is to have the documents published in time for IETF 97. A link to the
document cluster for all format drafts is here: https://www.rfc-
editor.org/cluster_info.php?cid=C294

The response period for the RFC Format Tools RFP has closed. The Tools
Management Committee is discussing the proposals received and hope to
have a recommendation to the IAOC in time for IETF 97. The related RFP
for the CSS was awarded to Spherical Cow Group; work has begun on that
aspect of the format project.

- Digital Signatures for RFCs
Due to some uncertainty about the overall security aspects of the
digital signature project, specifically around the handling of signing
key revocation, further work on the digital signature project is on hold
until key stakeholders can meet face to face immediately before IETF 97.
An updated proposal will be drafted after that discussion happens.

- IETF 97
The RSE will hold office hours at the RFC Editor desk on Monday
afternoon and Wednesday morning.

RPC update
- SLA
See: https://www.rfc-editor.org/report-summary/
The RPC met the SLA at Tier 2 for Q3.

Q4 2016: So far, Q4 has been quite busy, as the Format-related documents
have moved to AUTH48, an expedited request for https://
datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-netmod-routing-cfg/ has been
received, and a legal request has been received. In addition, the RFC
Editor is preparing for the upcoming IETF 97.

- Staffing
The RFC Editor requested funding for an additional editor because of the
increased format-related workload expected in 2017. The IAOC has
approved funding for July 2017 - December 2018.

Background: There is a significantly increased workload associated with
the transition to xml2rfc v3 for the RPC.

In addition to the editor team learning the v3 vocabulary and new tools,
the team needs to generate new procedures, update the RFC Editor website
regarding process, update their database to accommodate the multiple
file formats, and continue to simultaneously publish RFCs using the
existing v2 vocabulary and tools.

-

RFC Editor Liaison Report, November 2016

RFC Series Editor update

Format
The IAOC is still discussing the bids for the RFC Format tools work.
While those bids are under discussion, the work for the CSS has started
and an initial draft of the proposed look and feel has been released for
public comment
(https://rfc-format.github.io/draft-iab-rfc-css-bis/sample.html).
Feedback is being collected via rfc-interest and on github
(https://github.com/rfc-format/draft-iab-rfc-css-bis/issues).

Digital preservation
The data feed that allows the National Library of Sweden to ingest RFCs
into their digital repository has been complete. All past RFCs are now
archived in that repository, and all new RFCs will be added as they are
published.

Digital signatures
After several discussions over the course of IETF 97, the RFC Series
Editor and the RSOC agreed to move the digital signature project to
"dormant.". The goal of the project was to save the RPC time in
responding to subpoenas. Given the current state of understanding around
digital signatures in the legal community, the variation of proposed
expected practice in different jurisdictions, and the complexity of both
signing and verifying signatures over time, the goal of saving time
cannot be realized at this point. If and when technology and policy
change around digital signatures, we will review this project again.

RPC update
- SLA
See: https://www.rfc-editor.org/report-summary/
The RPC is meeting the SLA at Tier 1 for Q4.

- Staffing
Given the expected timing for the RFC Format project, the RFC Editor has
requested that the actual addition of the additional editor, approved
for July 2017-December 2018, be delayed until approximately three months
before the new format is expected to go into production (18 months after
the coding starts).

- IANA
The RPC is working with the IANA Services Operator to understand any
impact on RFC language based on the IANA IPR agreement.

### 4. Future Tech Plenaries


Allison Mankin reported that Dave Clark has accepted the IAB’s invitation to speak at the IETF 98 plenary. The Plenary Planning Program will follow up on this.


### 5. draft-iab-carisreport


Mat Ford will upload a new revision of draft-iab-carisreport that incorporates the comments received to date.


### 6. draft-iab-protocol-transitions


Dave Thaler reported that he has uploaded a new revision of draft-iab-protocol-transitions that incorporates the comments received to date with one exception; that comment was not addressed in the document because Dave could not come up with a way to generalize the comment enough for the document. The IAB agreed to review draft-iab-protocol-transitions-04 and decide whether it is ready for community review, and to think about whether there is a way to incorporate that last comment into the document.


### 7. Process for IAB Review under RFC 4846


The IAB received a request under RFC 4846 to review a draft that the Independent Stream Editor declined to publish. Robert Sparks and Ted Hardie will send a message to the ISE asking for the rationale for not publishing the document. The IAB will discuss potential additional reviewers of the document on the IAB list.


### 8. .homenet


Suzanne Woolf reported that draft-ietf-homenet-dot is currently in Working Group Last Call; the WGLC was cross-posted to the DNSOP list. Comments are starting to come in against the request to ask IANA for an update to the root zone to support an unsigned delegation of .homenet to IANA name servers and AS112. Suzanne and Suresh Krishnan will follow up with the IESG to make sure they are aware of the concerns about that request.


### 9. Followup on IAB appointments


Robert Sparks reported that Nevil Brownlee has accepted the reappointment as Independent Series Editor for a one-year term beginning in February 2017. Cindy Morgan will send a formal announcement.


Cindy Morgan reported that Kaveh Ranjbar has accepted the appointment to the IAOC for a two-year term beginning at IETF 98. Cindy will send a formal announcement.

#### 1.2. Administrivia


Cindy Morgan reminded the IAB that there are outstanding e-ballots to approve the minutes from the September IAB meetings.


An item on 3GPP and 5G was added to the agenda.


### 2. Tech Chat: Quo Vadis Our Internet?


Monique Morrow joined the IAB to give a preview of her presentation for the IETF 100 technical plenary.


As a methodology, one does not sit and ruminate on what the future will look like but rather observe patterns with 21st century systems anthropologist lens, and ask the questions of “what if,” “why not,” and “how.” We are confronted by parallel worlds, that which we reside today and that which is developing in front of us.


Whilst technology has been an enabler towards the development of the Internet, there are patterns that may challenge its very existence, such as “control by a few;” a growing trust deficit; the enhanced brain; humans as software; the tension between weapons of mass empowerment and those of mass destruction. With all the human enhancing tools at our disposal including personalized home robots, and the ability to heal ourselves, we can individually detect and respond to a threat. On the other hand, we could be the miscreant actors ourselves. Could we imagine a “stalemate” as the risks are so high towards community-driven mass destruction? Our brain will be the interface to everything. We will no longer type or swipe devices but rather command them with our brain. One could actually think of “reading” the other person’s thoughts where telepathic interactions are used daily. The “creepy” factor will set in very quickly and will require a “do not share” capability controlled by the mind. Ubiquitous telepathy and recording will challenge the expectations of privacy. On the other hand, we will learn languages and absorb knowledge in minutes.


The key message is that we need to assure that what we develop and how we deploy technology results in value to individuals and to our overall society. The IETF certainly has the potential to integrate ethics and governance now, in the future and for the sake of our humanity.


### 3. Tech Chat: The Future is Up in the Sky


Jonathan Brewer joined the IAB for a tech chat on satellite broadband.


As population density thins out, satellite becomes the least costly and complex method of delivering broadband. However, latency matters a lot in broadband. Users will notice latency if it is slower than 320 ms.


There are three orbital levels: low earth, medium earth, and  

geostationary. Most satellite service currently in use today use  

geostationary orbits.


Geostationary Earth Orbit:


* In use since 1965
* 400+ ms latency
* 3 satellites needed
* +/- 82° global coverage
* Stationary receiver dishes


Medium Earth Orbit:


* In use since 2014
* Around 120 ms latency
* 8+ satellites needed
* +/- 45° global coverage
* Receivers must track


Low Earth Orbit:


* The next Space Race
* Imperceptible latency
* 10s of satellites needed
* Global coverage
* Today only narrow-band


Waves in the air can travel 40% faster than waves in fiber optic cable, but things in the air (such as rain) can attenuate waves. Different frequencies have different properties; bigger waves behave differently from smaller ones.


Mark Nottingham asked if there are legal or governance issues with this style of Internet. Jonathan Brewer replied that there are some governments (e.g. India) that refuse to allow satellite services, so they may be geo-restricted.


Jonathan Brewer noted that one interesting thing to consider is how the protocols will evolve when broadband services with multiple latencies are working together.

#### 4.3. RFC Editor Liaison Report

```
RFC Series Editor Update

- Format
The IETF is discussing, at length, the recent non-ASCII publications,
RFCs 8187, 8264, 8265, and 8266. In particular, the community is
debating the addition of a BOM at the start of the .txt file. To
summarize the issue, see Unicode Consortium's FAQ
(http://www.unicode.org/faq/utf_bom.html#bom1)
on the matter:

"Can a UTF-8 data stream contain the BOM character (in UTF-8 form)? If
yes, then can I still assume the remaining UTF-8 bytes are in big-endian
order?

A: Yes, UTF-8 can contain a BOM. However, it makes no difference as to
the endianness of the byte stream. UTF-8 always has the same byte order.
An initial BOM is only used as a signature — an indication that an
otherwise unmarked text file is in UTF-8. Note that some recipients of
UTF-8 encoded data do not expect a BOM. Where UTF-8 is used
transparently in 8-bit environments, the use of a BOM will interfere
with any protocol or file format that expects specific ASCII characters
at the beginning, such as the use of "#!" of at the beginning of Unix
shell scripts."

Some people are arguing that a BOM should _only_ be used when absolutely
necessary, and that all things that would read or display a text
document should assume that text documents are UTF-8 encoded and
therefore would never actually require a BOM (thus making it not
necessary). Anything else is considered by these people to be an
inappropriate use of a BOM.

However, on the other hand, we have existence proof (research done by
Dave Thaler and posted by the RSE to the IETF list on September 19,
2017) that not all document readers (in particular some Microsoft tools)
are assuming UTF-8 for plain-text files, and are not displaying the
non-ASCII characters unless there is a BOM at the start of the file,
acting as that signature described above to give the tools the hint they
need to display everything correctly.

To add a final complication into the mix, a few community members have
pointed out that protocols such as FTP rely on the file extension to
suggest what encoding is being used, and as such, assume ASCII-only when
a .txt extension is used, regardless of the addition of the BOM.

At this time, no additional RFCs will be published with non-ASCII
characters, giving the community time to debate this further. Until new
information is offered, however, the RFC Editor will continue to use the
BOM when we start publishing documents with non-ASCII characters again
in the future (after the format tools are complete).

Timeline: For an update on the planning timeline for the tools aspect of
this project, see:

https://trac.tools.ietf.org/tools/ietfdb/wiki/FormatToolsPlan

Note that the tools noted with an asterix are expected to be
significantly delayed.

- Style Guide
An updated draft was posted for the Style Guide
(draft-flanagan-7322bis-02). The goal is to move ahead with the
publication process when the content of the draft and the abilities of
the tools used by the RPC and the community align. (For example, what
the Style Guide requires for reference formats for multi-document
sub-series cannot be supported by xml2rfc v2.)

RPC Update

- SLA
See: https://www.rfc-editor.org/report-summary/

The RPC currently is trending to be in Tier1 for Q3.
The Tier structure is a measure of the incoming workload. The expected
turnaround time is adjusted based on the incoming workload. The streams
have expressed they are content with the current rate of production.

From the Reports page notes:
Q3 2017: The RPC continues to work on their systems and tools in
preparation for the transition to host multiple file formats. The
editors continued id2xml testing and have started to use id2xml to
generate XML files when an author-submitted source file is not
available. In addition, the RPC tested how the existing system and tools
handle UTF-8 and made updates where possible. The editors completed
testing and worked with authors of selected documents through the AUTH48
process. The first RFCs that contain UTF-8 characters were published as
follows:

RFC 8187: Indicating Character Encoding and Language for HTTP Header
Field Parameters
RFC 8264: PRECIS Framework: Preparation, Enforcement, and Comparison of
Internationalized Strings in Application Protocols
RFC 8265: Preparation, Enforcement, and Comparison of Internationalized
Strings Representing Usernames and Passwords
RFC 8266: Preparation, Enforcement, and Comparison of Internationalized
Strings Representing Nicknames

The number of pages submitted and moved to EDIT has declined since Q1
2017 (see Figure 2). The decrease in submissions allowed the editors
more time to focus on testing and to prepare for the transition to new
format-related tools.

The RFC Editor responded to two legal requests.
```

### 5. BOF Coverage at IETF 100


The IAB discussed coverage for BOFs and proposed RGs at IETF 100, noting that the final agenda has not yet been published.


### 6. IAB Agenda at IETF 100


The IAB reviewed and discussed their agenda for IETF 100. Cindy Morgan will update the wiki and calendar based on the discussions.


The IAB plans to review the Measurement and Analysis for Protocols Research Group (MAPRG) on Thursday morning in Singapore.


### 7. RFC Series Editor


The IAB confirmed the RSOC’s recommendation for the RFC Series Editor (RSE) via e-vote. Ted Hardie will follow up with the IAOC.


### 8. ISE Announcement


Ted Hardie will announce that the IAB has appointed Adrian Farrel as the Independent Submission Editor (ISE) as of 15 February 2018.


### 9. 3GPP and 5G


Jari Arkko reported that there was a call on 13 October between the  

3GPP-IETF liaisons, 3GPP leadership, and IETF experts on HTTP/2 usage  

for 3GPP’s new Service Based Architecture (SBA).


The purpose of the call was to inform the experts on 3GPP’s efforts in designing the SBA, to get advice regarding general approaches to requirements that are likely to come up, and get an understanding of what the process is from the IETF side on any extensions, should there be need for some. 3GPP will use HTTP2 for their new 5G core network signaling.


Jari Arkko noted that they are trying to set up a similar call with people involved in using EAP in 5G networks.

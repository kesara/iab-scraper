### 5. Regular Liaison Reports


Because there will not be a telechat during the week after IETF, the regular reports are included in this meetings session.


#### IESG Liaison Report Dan Romascanu


* A number of IETF experts (Routing co-AD, MPLS and PWE3 chairs) participated as individuals in an ITU-T SG 15 Interim Meeting in Ottawa, Canada, June 19-23, 2006. The focus was on T-MPLS and related discussions, as the MPLS and PWE3 WGs chairs being approached specifically on this subject by the ITU-T. Following the meeting, a liaison letter was drafted, discussed and published at https://datatracker.ietf.org/public/liaison\_detail.cgi?detail\_id=241. The letter recommends that G.8110.1 not be published in the form that was consented prior to the Ottawa meeting, and that instead the substantial improvements that were proposed in the Ottawa meeting be incorporated in the text. Also, time is required for an additional round of review and feedback from the IETF, specifically in the PWE3, CCAMP and MPLS WGs.
* The IESG discussed the appeals from Dean Anderson and JFC Morfin during a IESG-only telechat on 6/29. Proposals for responses to the appeal are being circulated and may be approved at the IESG telechat on 7/5.


#### IRTF Aaron Falk


Aaron and Eric received a first version of the scalable multicast slides for the technical plenary and have begun to provide feedback.


#### RFC Editor Report Joyce K. Reynolds


* We will have our RFC Editor office set up at the Montreal IETF.
* The RFC Editor will present its tutorial Sunday afternoon in Montreal.
* We intend to present our traditional RFC Editor report during Wednesday night’s plenary.
* The RFC Editor Editorial Board will hold a meeting on Monday of the IETF.
* The TLG will meet on Tuesday to discuss RFC Editor operations.  

#### ISOC Report Lynn St. Amour


No report.


Leslie reported on the ISOC BoT readout. The ISOC BoT voiced some concerns about wheter the recent uptick in appeals was a trend and whether there should be an anticipation of increased legal costs and the IAB guesses this may just be a statistical bunching.


### 6. IETF 66 Planning


* plenary planning
The IAB discussed the logistics and presentations for the Thursday night technical plenary.
* BOF handling
The IAB discussed the BOFs and meetings that members need to attend and made sure that all the meetings would be covered.


The IAB discussed the agenda of its other meetings during IETF week.


### 7. Variance Request from Simon Josefsson


The IAB reviewed Leslie’s proposed response text and agreed to send it.


### 8. Next Steps on Network Neutrality

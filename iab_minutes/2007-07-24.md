### 2. ITU-T Meeting Review


It was noted that there was an informal meeting between IAB and ITU-T leadership in Chicago, held the day before the IETF meeting agenda commenced. The goal of the gathering was to foster inter-personal relationships which might help with future organisational interaction.


### 3. Enterprise Workshop


The proposal to host a routing and addressing workshop directed at enterprises was discussed, in order to determine whether there was forward progress.


The potential utility of such a workshop was discussed at some length. A need for external consultation amongst key enterprise segments was identified. Lixia Zhang, Kevin Fall and Danny McPherson to consult with various enterprises with whom they have appropriate contacts. The topic will be re-visited in September 2007.


### 4. NomCom


The question of whether incumbent members of the IAB should announce to the community their intention to stand again, or not to stand, was discussed. Various personal opinions about consequences of such statements were expressed. After some discussion, it was decided that no IAB statement regarding the intentions of incumbents should be made. It was noted that individuals are free to communicate their intentions (or not) as they see fit.


### 5. Technical Plenary


Logistics for the technical plenary were discussed. The IAB Chairâ€™s slideset had been circulated prior to the meeting, and there was no further feedback received.


### 6. Review of Action Items


Review of action items was deferred due to lack of time.

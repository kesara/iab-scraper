### 4. IPv6 Statement Distribution


The IAB agreed on the list of organizations that should be sent a pointer about the IAB statement on IPv6. Lee Howard will send a message to the liaison managers of those organizations and ask them to make note of the IAB statement.


### 5. IAB Stream Document Stream Manager


Andrew Sullivan noted that the IAB Chair has been considered the default stream manager for the IAB RFC stream, and asked if this could be delegated. From the RFC Editor perspective, the stream manager is responsible for policy decisions relating to the IAB stream; the IAB agreed that it should be the IAB as a whole that makes any policy decisions, but that the stream manager would act as a liaison from the IAB to the RFC Editor.


After discussion, the IAB agreed to appoint Robert Sparks as the IAB Document Stream Manager. Robert will work with Cindy Morgan and AMS IT to set up a new email alias for the stream manager.

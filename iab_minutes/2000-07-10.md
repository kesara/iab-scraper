### NOTES:


#### 1. review actions

see above


#### 2. review drafts in progress

see above


 “Case for IPv6” document received additional discussion: General consensus was that we want to get a document of this general character out as an IAB authored document. However, current document would require significant work from a current IAB member to serve this purpose, and turn-around from current author(s) has been slow. Tony Hain indicated that this sort of document now fell into the scope of his day job and volunteered to take it on. First step Tony will take is:

- Get in touch with Charlie Perkins and see if he is comfortable with the IAB taking it over entirely. If “yes”, Tony will make the next editing pass and it will really turn into an IAB document. If “no”, Tony starts over; Charlie can do what he wants with the current document (e.g., request publication as an individual submission, etc.).

#### 3. administrivia


 Face-face meeting Tuesday evening in Pittsburgh.  

August 14 teleconf will be held.

#### 4. IRTF news


 AAA architecture docs. on track to be published as RFCs. Plenary presentation at IETF in Pittsburgh.  

 Network Management RG would also like to present a plenary–they are ready to hand off some work to IETF.  

Most research groups will be meeting around Pittsburgh IETF.

#### 5. IESG liaison report


#### 6. Other liaisons and external issues

#### 6.1 Nomination to the PC for the ICANN board.


IETF NomComm has come up with a list of two qualified candidates. Guidance is that we should submit only one candidate to ICANN. IAB consensus to submit first name.


#### 6.2 3GPP/IETF–attempt to publicly announce formal liaison has been fixed.


#### 6.3 ICANN and .ARPA (again)–apparently under control.


#### 7. Copyright and boilerplate issues

Joint copyright with W3C–under control. IAB needs to approve joint copyright on documents on a case-by-case basis. IAB authorized RFC Editor to put joint copyright on XML documents.


#### 8. Pittsburgh Agenda — IAB and Plenary meetings

Face-face meeting: Make progress on new (interesting and architectural) work items (QOS, high availability, “middleware”). Jon Crowcroft will kick off discussion with a short presentation.


 Plenary:


 Update by RFC Editor.  

Overview of IAB actions, workshops and documents published over the past year.

#### 9. Joint NM meeting.

IETF hosted a management summit last week of all those interested in Internet network management (TMN1, Open Network Management ETSI, Tiphon, etc.). Issue for IETF is resolving tension between value of cooperation/acting as more formal player vs. diluting IETF efforts. Will be discussed at joint IAB/IETF breakfast at Pittsburgh.

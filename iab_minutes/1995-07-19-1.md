### NOTES:


#### 1. Agree on agenda.


#### 2. Review of outstanding action items.


#### 3. Elect a new chair.


Brian Carpenter was unanimously elected. The new chair was speechless.
 The IAB expressed its deep appreciation of Christian’s skill and diplomacy as Chair during a particularly important period of the Internet’s development.
 


#### 4. The escape clause draft (where is it?).


It was agreed that the procedure would be better named a variance, rather than an escape clause.
 The basic process has three steps: some body needs to decide that there exists a deadlock, some body has to propose a solution, there has to be an extended last call, and then some body needs to review the solution if there is a dispute. It was generally agreed that these bodies should be the IESG, the IESG, and the IAB, respectively. 


#### 5. The “Best Current Practices” draft.


BCPs are informational RFCs that go through IETF review (last call, IESG review) that describe best current practices.
 The consensus was that the IAB thinks this is a good thing–other than the awkward name. 


#### 6. Request for guidance on rfc1814 (“unique addresses are good”)


The IAB asked the IANA to respond to Kim Hubbard.
 The IAB endorses the IANA as the body to resolve regional issues. 


#### 7. Information infrastructure IRTF research area and groups.


Chris Weider spoke about the proposal to create an IAB study group and IRTF research groups to address information infrastructure issues. Many people believe that the IETF is the correct place to set standards in this area, but some of the issues still require research, so they should be started in the IRTF and moved into IETF working groups when ready.


### Future Meetings.



 August 8, 10-12 EDT.  

It was agreed that in future we will hold regular teleconferences 10-12 US Eastern time on the second Tuesday of each month.

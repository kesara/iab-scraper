Internet Society Liaison Report to the IAB
29 January 2013

Topics:

II. ITU-T SG2 Numbering, Naming, Addressing and Identification
III. Informal Expert Group (IEG) for the World Telecommunication/ICT Policy Forum (WTPF)
IV. IETF Orlando - Policy Program
V. APEC Electronic Commerce Steering Group

I. Routing Resiliency Measurements Workshop Report
The report from the Internet Society's Routing Resiliency Measurements
Workshop has been published and is available here:
http://www.internetsociety.org/doc/report-routing-resiliency-measurements-workshop.

II. ITU-T SG2 Numbering, Naming, Addressing and Identification
The Internet Society (Karen Mulberry) is participating in the 22-31
January ITU-T SG2 meeting, which is the first session in the new study
period and under the new study group leadership team assembled by Sherif
Guinena (Egypt) SG2 Chairman. New emphasis is being placed on misuse,
requirements for TSB allocation of resources, mobile identifiers and
defining the future of numbering e.g. M2M and the Internet of Things.

III. Informal Expert Group (IEG) for the World Telecommunication/ICT Policy Forum (WTPF)
The IEG WTPF will be meeting 6-8 February in Geneva for the final
preparatory meeting to review the Secretary General’s Report on this
year’s theme: Issues raised in - Resolution 101: IP-based networks;
Resolution 102: ITU’s role in international policy issues pertaining to
the Internet and management of Internet resources, including domain
names and addresses; and Resolution 133 Roles of administration of
Member States in the management of internationalized domain names.
This Report becomes the basis for discussion along with prepared
Opinions for the WTPF meeting in May. The Opinions contain suggested
scope, and responsibilities for the ITU, Member States and the private
sector and focus on items related to the WTPF theme. Draft Opinions
that have been contributed by IEG members will also be reviewed at this
meeting.

IV. IETF Orlando - Policy Program
Once again, the Internet Society will host a group of policymakers at
IETF Orlando. For this meeting, we have 9 policymakers confirmed to
attend, primarily from the Latin America / Caribbean region. The focus
of the program will, as always, be on introducing the policymakers to
the IETF mission, activities and processes. We'll also hold some focused
sessions on topics related to routing, interconnection and combatting
spam. These are topics of key interest in the region and are
particularly relevant post-WCIT.

V. APEC Electronic Commerce Steering Group
The Internet Society (Christine Runnegar) is participating in the
Electronic Commerce Steering Group (ECSG) meetings at the APEC Senior
Officials Meeting 1 (SOM1) in Jakarta, Indonesia, commencing on 30
January 2013. This will include the informal and formal meetings of the
Data Privacy and Paperless Trading Sub-Groups. A key area of focus will
be the implementation of the APEC Cross Border Privacy Rules System, its
possible extension to processors, and mapping to other transborder
systems.

VI. Council of Europe
The Internet Society (Christine Runnegar) will be participating in the
Bureau of the Consultative Committee of the Convention for the
Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of
Personal Data (T-PD), meeting in Strasbourg (5-7 February 2013). At the
plenary last November, we helped the T-PD finalise its proposals on the
modernization of Convention 108. The proposals can be found here:

The W3C Privacy Interest Group held its monthly call on 24 January 2013.
The topics for this month included privacy reviews of draft
specifications from the Device API WG (Ambient Light Events and
Proximity Events), as well as ongoing work (privacy considerations for
Web standards and guidance on fingerprinting).

1. RSE Report

Update on Active Projects

the requirements as documented. The comment period runs through the end
of February.

development of the revised Style Guide. Her perspective from her time
as an editor for the Series and her general expertise will be of great
value towards helping understand the ramifications of potential changes.

Other items of note
* RFC Editor face to face meeting
The RSE and RFC Production Center staff had a very productive meeting
at the AMS offices in January. Primary topics included detailed Style
Guide discussion and project prioritization for 2013 and 2014

http://wiki.tools.ietf.org/group/irtf/trac/wiki/nwcrg. They asked for
a room for a side meeting in Orlando, which I approved. At the moment,
there is not a lot of activity visible to me, but let's see what
happens at the meeting.

- P2PRG will close after the RFC Editor publishes its final document
(any day now I guess.)

- The clock is running out on the ASRG trying to become more active.
They may close soon, too.

chairs. Ticket has been filed in May 2012. No activity since.

Internet Society Liaison Report to the IAB
14 November 2013

Topics:

I. Policy Fellows and IAB program participation
II. IGF 2013
III. Reducing Internet Latency
IV. DNSSEC History Project
V. Council of Europe, Conference of Ministers

I. Policy Fellows and IAB program participation
ISOC staff engaged with the group of ten public policy guests invited to 
participate in the IETF88 meeting. General feedback received from the 
guests was very positive, for example, "The passion and enthusiasm for 
the Internet model and open debate is evident and inspiring." In 
addition, the policy guests found the IGOVupate BOF extremely useful. 
ISOC staff also participated in the IAB Privacy Program tutorial, the 
IAB Emergency Services Initiative and the IAB Privacy Program.

II. IGF 2013
The 8th Internet Governance Forum (IGF) was held in Bali, Indonesia, 
from 22 to 25 October 2013 and focused on “Building bridges – Enhancing 
multistakeholder cooperation for growth and sustainable development”. 
The event gathered around 1,500 participants from 111 countries, 
including Ministers, members of Parliaments and senior officials. The 
ambitious objective of the Bali meeting was to build bridges and 
strengthen the cooperation between and among various stakeholders, 
allowing and strengthening a constructive multistakeholder dialogue.  

The Internet Society, including Lynn St. Amour, ISOC’s President and 
CEO, Markus Kummer, in his capacity as interim chair of the MAG and Open 
Consultations, and Constance Bommelaer, MAG member, were all actively 
engaged and visible at the event.  An account of ISOC’s activities and 
the complete list of ISOC speaking roles are available on our website: 
http://www.internetsociety.org/igf/2013-igf-mini-site

III. Reducing Internet Latency
ISOC have presented a couple of readouts from the Reducing Internet 
Latency workshop held in September: at the Capacity Sharing Workshop 
(CSWS) 2013, in Göttingen, Germany on October 7, and at the IETF'S 
TSVAREA meeting on November 7. A written report from the workshop is 
forthcoming.

IV. DNSSEC History Project
The DNSSEC History Project has been (re)launched -- check out the story 
as we have it so far and please do contribute more input to round out 
the history:http://www.internetsociety.org/deploy360/blog/2013/10/
introducing-the-dnssec-history-project-can-you-help-complete-the-story/

V. Council of Europe, Conference of Ministers
Markus Kummer attended the Council of Europe Conference of Ministers 
responsible for Media and Information Society on "Freedom of Expression 
and Democracy in the Digital Age", held in Belgrade, Serbia on 7-8 
November.  He was speaker in two sessions and rapporteur of a session on 
"access to the Internet and fundamental rights". This provided an 
excellent opportunity to recall the nexus between the underlying 
Internet technology as an enabler of human rights and to warn against 
imposing new borders on the Internet in reacting against government 
surveillance activities. ISOC had a major impact on the outcome 
documents which include concepts introduced by ISOC, such as a 
commitment to preserve "the Internet's open architecture, supported and 
enhanced by open standards, development processes, and promoting 
innovation in the bottom up, decentralised multi-stakeholder manner 
which has proved so successful for the rapid evolution and spread of 
access to the Internet" as well as a commitment "to do no harm to the 
Internet and to preserve its universality, integrity and openness".

I.  Public Comments needing attention
====================================
(http://www.icann.org/en/news/public-comment)

Currently there seems to be nothing that in my mind would be not
interesting for the IETF/IAB:

Consultation on ccTLD Delegation and Redelegation User Instructions and
Source of Policy and Procedures
<http://www.icann.org/en/news/public-comment/cctld-drd-ui-policy-09sep13-en .htm> (Finished)

Draft Final Report on Protection of IGO and INGO Identifiers in All gTLDs
<http://www.icann.org/en/news/public-comment/igo-ingo-final-20sep13-en.htm>
(November 1st)

Study on Whois Privacy & Proxy Service Abuse
<http://www.icann.org/en/news/public-comment/whois-pp-abuse-study-24sep13-e n.htm> (November 13th)

Revised Public Interest Commitments Dispute
Resolution Procedure (PICDRP)
<http://www.icann.org/en/news/public-comment/draft-picdrp-02oct13-en.htm>
(November 14th)

Second Accountability and Transparency Review Team (ATRT 2) Draft Report &
Recommendations 
<http://www.icann.org/en/news/public-comment/atrt2-recommendations-21oc t13-en.htm> (December 13th)

II.  Upcoming topics that could be relevant
==========================================

Technical Liaison Group (TLG) reorganization
--------------------------------------------

The TLG is described in the ICANN by-laws in section 2 of
http://www.icann.org/en/about/governance/bylaws#XI-A

ICANN board is discussing the reorganization of the TLG. The TLG is a
strange construction consisting of ETSI, ITU-T, W3C, and IETF/IAB. Each
organization is supposed to propose two technical experts to provide
technical guidance for the board. In addition, IETF/IAB appoints a
technical liaison to the ICANN board and to the ICANN NomCom. ETSI, ITU-T,
W3C have also a yearly changing liaison to the board where the W3C, ETSI
(current), and ITU-T alternate. This means that one person is parachuted
for a year to the board, and then the next organization takes over the
year later. It is generally understood that this rotation does not work.
In addition, the two technical experts have never been nominated/used.

The proposed changes are to eliminate the rotating TLG liaison position
and to really appoint the two technical experts. This does not change the
role of the IETF liaison's role, but calls for the nomination of two
technical experts. The IETF liaison to the ICANN board can be one of the
experts or be somebody else.

The ICANN board chair, Steve Crocker, has sent a mail to Russ and Jari on
October 15th about this.

The purpose of this change is to make the system work better and to
provide better technical guidance to ICANN and its board.

Name collision management
-------------------------

The name collision topic has been very hot in ICANN. ICANN board came up
with a resolution on a name collision management plan in the recent
meeting of the New gTLD Program Committee (NGPC) meeting:
http://newgtlds.icann.org/en/blog/ngpc-resolutions-contracting-20oct13-en

The plan was done with relatively short timeframe, but it got a relatively
good review from technical people including Ram Mohan, Suzanne Wolf, and
myself. The actual "New gTLD Collision Occurrence Management" document can
be found at 
http://www.icann.org/en/groups/board/documents/resolutions-new-gtld-annex-1
-07oct13-en.pdf

The idea is to defer the delegation of "home" and "corp" indefinitely and
to include a collision management framework.

Internet Governance
-------------------

The Montevideo outcome has been discussed heavily in the Internet
Governance circles. However, I assume this will be discussed anyways
within the IAB from IETF/IAB point of view.

III.  (If relevant) upcoming meeting topics of importance
========================================================

The next ICANN meeting will be at Buenos Aires in Argentina November
17th-21st. The agenda will be posted on October 28th at
http://buenosaires48.icann.org/sched-overview. The discussion topics will
contain the Expert Working Group on Next Generation Registration Directory
Service (whois), the ICANN strategic plan and the strategic panels, and
other ICANN topics. More about the meeting when the agenda is posted.

#### 2.5. RFC Editor Liaison Report


–Begin RFC Editor Liaison Report, Heather Flanagan–



```
Please see the RFC Editor report
(http://www.ietf.org/proceedings/88/slides/slides-88-iesg-opsplenary-1.pdf)
posted for IETF 88.  This covers stats and highlights through October
2013.  A few additional notes are below:

1. RSE Report
* RFC Format
While the major updates were presented at IETF 88, one additional note
worth mentioning is the RFC Format BoF.  This was a fairly successful
BoF; most of the room had read the necessary material before hand and
the questions at the mic were more in the way of clarification and a
request to do more with PDF than just have it be a representation of the
text.

2. RFC Production Center Report
* RSS feed of recently published RFCs
An RSS feed has been created for recently published RFCs.  These notices
provide links to the RFC info pages.  See
http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfcrss.xml

* Updates to Info Pages
The RFC Info Pages now have links to IETF IPR disclosures as well as
links to the citation library to help authors cite an RFC. 

* RFC search page (http://www.rfc-editor.org/search/rfc_search.php)
Improvements have been made to the RFC search page based on feedback
from the community.  Specifically:
o Added "AND" functionality for searching by Title/Keyword (and
abstract). Example: ability to search for RFCs about SIP AND security.
o Added "This month" and "This year" for quick links under Publication Date.
o Now allowing "-" and "." to be included in the Author (last name)
variable to allow for names like "Saint-Andre" and "St. Johns"

October Stats for the RFC Editor
Submissions: 26
Publications: 17

### 3. IGOVUPDATE at IETF 89


The IAB agreed to defer substantive discussion of the IGOVUPDATE session at IETF 89 to a future meeting, but did note that if outside speakers are to be invited it would be better to know that sooner rather than later.


### 4. ITAT Workshop Update


Eliot Lear reported that the ITAT Workshop is on track for 4-5 December 2013. Eliot will distribute the papers via the mailing list to encourage discussion before the workshop.


### 5. Liaison Oversight Program


The IAB approved adding Thomas Narten to the Liaison Oversight Program.


### 6. RPKI/BGPSEC Tech Chat with Sharon Goldberg


After looking at available dates, the IAB agreed to invite Sharon Goldberg to speak at an IAB Tech Chat on RPKI/BGPSEC on 15 January 2014. Bernard Aboba will issue the invitation on behalf of the IAB.


### 7. Conference Call Schedule


The IAB agreed to the following upcoming conference call dates:


* 27 November 2013: IAB Business Meeting

* 15 January 2014: IAB Tech Chat on RPKI/BGPSEC


Cindy Morgan will update the internal calendar accordingly.


### 8. draft-farrell-perpass-attack-00


The IAB discussed a potential IAB note on draft-farrell-perpass-attack, noting the IAB’s endorsement of the document, which will be processed through the IETF stream. The IAB agreed to wait until the document has been sent to the IESG to ask the IESG to add the IAB Note. The current “IAB and IESG Note” heading in section 3 will be changed to “Process Note.”


Eliot Lear will draft a message for the IAB Chair to send encouraging the IETF community to participate in the discussion of draft-farrell-perpass-attack.


### 9. ICANN Technical Liaison Group appointment


Marc Blanchet formally recused himself from the discussion and left the teleconference.


The ICANN Technical Liaison Group appointment was discussed in an Executive Session.


The Call for Comments on the volunteers will go out to the IETF community at the end of this week. Ross Callon, Eliot Lear, and Andrew Sullivan will interview the candidates on behalf the IAB.


### 10. Other Business


There was no other business, and the meeting was adjourned.

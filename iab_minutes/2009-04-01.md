### 2. ISOC BoT Selection


The only agenda item for this meeting was to finalize the IAB selection of an ISOC Board Trustee. The IAB had already discussed the candidates via email, and had conducted an initial straw poll. After significant deliberation, the group selected Eric Burger as the IAB-appointed Trustee on the ISOC Board. The decision will now go to the IESG for confirmation.

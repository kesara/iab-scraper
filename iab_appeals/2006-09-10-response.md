Subject: Appeal of IESG Decision of July 10, 2006


On September 10, the IAB received an appeal from Dean Anderson on the  

IESG’s decision to Last Call draft-ietf-grow-anycast-03.


1. SUMMARY OF IAB RESPONSE


The appeal is denied.


2. BACKGROUND


draft-ietf-grow-anycast, “Operation of Anycast Services” is a work item  

of the GROW WG. In response to a request [0] from the WG chair, Geoff  

Huston, to advance the document to BCP the IESG issued an IETF Last Call  

on June 2, 2006. Mr. Anderson appealed the issuing of the Last Call to the  

IESG which denied the appeal. Mr. Anderson subsequently appealed to the IAB.


Timeline:  

Jun 2, 2006: The IESG issues an IETF Last Call for draft-ietf-grow-anycast-03.  

Jun 13, 2006: Mr. Anderson appeals the Last Call.  

Jul 1, 2006: Mr. Huston issues a WG LC for draft-ietf-grow-anycast-04  

Jul 10, 2006: The IESG rejects Mr. Anderson’s appeal.  

Jul 26, 2006: Mr. Huston calls WG consensus.  

Aug 30, 2006: The IESG issues an IETF Last Call for draft-ietf-grow-anycast-04.  

Sep 10, 2006: Mr. Anderson appeals to the IAB.


Mr. Anderson’s appeal raises four objections, one substantive and three  

procedural:


S1. The document is technically flawed.  

P1. The WG Chair (Mr. Huston) was incorrect to declare consensus  

 on the document as advanced and therefore the IESG was incorrect  

 to Last Call it.  

P2. The document relies upon claims by Daniel Karrenberg about the  

 behavior of Anycast DNS and these claims were scientifically  

 fraudulent.  

P3. That a number of IETF participants, including, but not limited to  

 IESG members Brian Carpenter and David Kessens had conflicts  

 of interest which should have caused them to recuse themselves  

 from decisions.


3. ANALYSIS


S1. Technical Flaws  

Because the disposition of this document has not yet been decided on  

by the IESG and part of the purpose of IESG review is evaluating the  

quality of the technology, the possible existence of technical flaws  

is not yet appealable. The IAB notes that the IETF Last Call has expired  

and encourages the IESG to treat the technical comments in this appeal  

as Last Call comments.


P1. Adequacy of WG Process  

Mr. Anderson argues that the WG Chair was incorrect to declare consensus.  

The IAB has reviewed the mailing list traffic during the Last Call and is  

satisfied that there was indeed rough consensus to advance the -02 version  

of the draft to the IESG. Indeed, Mr. Anderson appears to have conceded  

this point [1]:


 Rather, my interest now is to record that there were objections  

 raised at the time. I’m willing to acknowledge that these  

 objections were a minority view. I appreciate your attention  

 to the accuracy of the record.


Mr. Anderson also raises the issue of the WGLC having been made on the  

-02 draft, whereas the -04 draft is being advanced. The changes between  

these document versions are minimal in the judgement of the IAB and are  

with the range of normal changes made without issuing subsequent WGLCs.


Finally, on July 1, 2006, Mr. Huston issued a WGLC [2] on the -04 draft  

and called consensus on July 26, 2006 [3]. This WGLC occurred subsequent  

to Mr. Anderson’s appeal to the IESG but prior to the issuance of the IETF  

Last Call. In this WGLC, responses were overwhelmingly in favor of  

advancement, with only Mr. Anderson objecting. Mr. Anderson’s objections  

to the decision to IETF Last Call the -03 version of the document are  

therefore moot.


P2. Scientific Fraud  

Mr. Anderson claims that this document is based on scientific fraud in that  

it relies on assertions that stateful DNS worked, made by Daniel Karrenberg  

without showing supporting measurements. The IAB’s review of Anderson’s  

appeal uncovers only a presentation [4] by Mr. Karrenberg in which he  

presents some measurements about BGP stability and says (on slide 72):


 Plea


 This does not mean that anycast for DNS root service is unstable  

 or broken.


 Please do not spread this false rumor!


However the data and its possible interpretations are judged, Mr. Anderson  

does not show that the WG relied upon Mr. Karrenberg’s claims in order to  

advance the document. Indeed, draft-ietf-grow-anycast-04 contains substantial  

material about situations in which use of Anycast is problematic (see  

Section 4), so it is clear that the WG considered this issue.


P3. Conflicts of Interest  

Mr. Anderson argues that IESG members Brian Carpenter and David Kessens  

and WG Chair Mr. Huston had conflicts of interest and should have recused  

themselves from this decision. The IAB has reviewed the record and found  

no evidence of relevant conflict of interest.


CONCLUSION  

The technical issue raised by Mr. Anderson is not appealable at this time.  

The IAB has reviewed the procedural issues raised by Mr. Anderson and on  

the basis of the available record, the IAB concludes that the WG Chair  

acted correctly in calling WG consensus and the IESG acted correctly in  

issuing the IETF Last Call. We therefore conclude that the appeal should  

be denied and the original IESG decision upheld.


Note: IAB members Kurt Lindqvist and Olaf Kolkman recused themselves from  

this decision.

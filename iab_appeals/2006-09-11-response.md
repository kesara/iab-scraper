IAB Response to an Appeal from J-F C. Morfin.


On September 9, 2006 the IAB received an appeal against several  

previous IESG appeals from J-F C. Morfin dismissed by the IESG.


1. Introduction


Mr. Morfin’s appeal contains 25 pages of text with a lot of background  

and material. Based on the section on “Purpose of this appeal”, the IAB  

concluded that Mr. Morfin was seeking redress for the following three  

complaints relating to a PR Action affecting Mr Morfin initiated in  

February 2006.


Ia. Against the decision to Last Call the PR Action Ib. Against  

the decision on the PR Action.


II. Against the IESG deciding the PR Action prior to the processing  

 Mr. Morfin’s 2006/02/17 appeal.


On matters Ia and Ib we uphold the decisions of the IESG. Our reasoning  

is presented in section 2 below.


On matter II, while the IAB has some concerns regarding the time it  

took the IESG to handle the appeal, we uphold the ultimate decision  

of the IESG to decide on the appeal action prior to processing the Feb  

17 appeal. In section 3 we provide arguments and advice on this matter.


2. Last Call of and PR action.


There are a number of issues that we identified in the appeal to the  

Last Call and the actual PR action.


 \* Mr. Morfin argues that RFC 3683 is in conflict with the universal  

 declaration of human rights.


Our view, supported by our legal counsel, is that the Universal  

Declaration of Human Rights is not directed to non political-state  

behavior and a discussion of this instrument, no matter how admirable  

it may be, is not relevant to the appeal at hand.


 \* Mr. Morfin argues that various participants have conflicts of interest.


We reviewed and did not agree with Mr. Morfin that there were any  

supportable conflicts of interest relevant to the PR action.


 \* Mr. Morfin argues that the PR Last Call was invalid because it did  

 not contain Mr. Alvestrand’s original request to the IESG.


RFC 3683 clearly states that the PR action is initiated by an AD. That  

Mr. Alvestrand’s request lead to the PR action is irrelevant to the Last Call.


 \* Mr. Morfin argues he is actually not disrupting the  

 consensus-driven process.


Mr. Morfin argues that RFC 3683 does not apply to expert review lists  

because they are not consensus driven. In the IAB’s opinion, this  

is an overly strict interpretation of non-normative text in RFC 3638.  

RFC3683’s purpose is to provide guidelines for handling disruption in  

the open mailing lists that are at core to the IETF work. In RFC3683  

the disruption of the consensus-driven process is provided as an example.


 \* Mr. Morfin argues that a PR action based on behavior on lists or in  

 working groups that have ceased to exist is moot.


An RFC 3683 PR action allows maintainers of lists under IETF auspices  

to revoke a subject’s posting rights. These PR actions are based on  

observed behavior of the subject. The action is not based on where  

within the IETF context, that behavior took place. That the list and  

working group do not exist or are inactive is irrelevant.


 \* Mr. Morfin argues that he was not disruptive but rather others  

 were acting against him and that the PR Last Call contained  

 pointers to disruptive messages towards him.


The pointers that were provided in the Last Call were, in majority,  

warnings and suspension messages. Technically Mr. Morfin is correct  

that those messages all contain actions directed towards him. However,  

to us it is clear that the content of those messages contain references  

that demonstrated the behavior leading to the PR action.


 \* Mr. Morfin argues that because the decision’s votes were not  

 published, and voting does not constitute the usual  

 consensus-based process, the decision by the IESG is invalid.


We are of the opinion that the use of voting as an instrument to judge  

if consensus exists is not unusual. There is no requirement to publish  

the result of those votes. There is no indication that within the IESG  

there was not rough consensus on the decision.


 \* Mr. Morfin finally argues that the PR action is partly based on a  

 suspension that the IAB overturned.


We overturned the suspension by Mr. Alvestrand on procedural grounds.  

The fact that the suspension by Mr. Alvestrand is used as a pointer  

to the alleged misbehavior is not sufficient grounds to revert the PR action.


3. The timing of the PR decision.


 \* Mr. Morfin argues that the IESG should have first dealt with his  

 appeal on the Last Call before deciding on the PR action  

 itself. Mr. Morfin also complains about the length between  

 filing the appeal and receiving an answer.


The IESG response to the appeal states:


 The IESG decided not to consider this appeal until after deciding  

 the PR-action, and then not to do so until Mr Morfin’s expected  

 appeal against the PR-action.


It is within normal IETF practice to not stop operation in the face of  

an active appeal, and the IAB therefore believes the IESG was within  

its rights to decide the PR-action prior to the appeal.


However, we believe that appeal bodies should not block consideration  

of an appeal based on expectations of future appeals, except when  

clearly communicated with the appellant. Rather, each appeal should  

be expediently considered as it is received.


Hence, while the IAB upholds the ultimate result of the appeal, we  

believe the IESG acted inappropriately in not immediately considering  

the appeal. Future appeals should be considered without waiting  

for additional appeals, except as agreed on by the appellant.


Mr. Morfin argues that the decision to withdraw the appeal agenda item  

was itself a decision on the appeal. The IAB does not agree with that  

interpretation.

Subj: IAB Response to Appeal by Dean Anderson dated 18 April 2006


Executive Summary


 On 18 April 2006, the IAB received an appeal from Dean Anderson  

 regarding the decision, on appeal, of the IESG to uphold their  

 previous decision to issue an RFC 3683 Posting Rights Action (PR-  

 action) removing his posting rights on the IETF discussion list.  

 The IAB has now considered this appeal, deciding that the appeal is  

 denied and the IESG’s decision in this matter is upheld.


1. Introduction


 On 18 April 2006, the IAB received an appeal from Dean Anderson  

 regarding the decision, on appeal, of the IESG to uphold their  

 previous decision to issue an RFC 3683 [RFC3683] Posting Rights  

 Action (PR-action) removing his posting rights on the IETF  

 discussion list. According to the procedures in Section 6.5.2 of  

 [RFC2026], the IAB has reviewed the situation and issues the  

 following response.


2. The Appeal Question


 The appeal from Dean Anderson as submitted can be found at  

 http://www.iab.org/appeals/2006-04-18-anderson-appeal.html. The  

 IAB has interpreted the appeal in this extensive document as  

 requiring consideration of the following matters:


 1. Did the evidence warrant the issue of the PR-action?


 2. Was the procedure of Section 2 of RFC3683 followed adequately up  

 to when the initial PR-action was issued for Last Call?


 3. Should any members of the IESG have recused themselves who  

 didn’t?


 4. Did the IETF Last Call reach a consensus that the PR-action was  

 appropriate, was this consensus unduly affected by its original  

 incorrect announcement resulting in the extended duration of the  

 Last Call and was the consensus correctly called by the IESG?


 5. Was the evidence examined fairly and without malice?


 6. Did the IESG correctly action the appeal as specified by Section  

 6.5.4 of RFC 2026?


 These matters will be addressed point by point in Section 5.


3. The Scope and Basis of the Appeal


 Mr Anderson seeks resolution of both a working group dispute under  

 RFC 2026 Section 6.5.1 and resolution of process failure under RFC  

 2026 Section 6.5.2. The IESG PR-action that is the focus of the  

 dispute has no direct connection to working group processes. The  

 IAB has therefore restricted its considerations to matters of  

 potential process failure in the IESG’s handling of the PR-action.  

 This requires checking that Section 2 of RFC 3683 was followed for  

 the original process and Section 6.5.4 of RFC 2026 was followed by  

 the IESG for the subsequent appeal.


 The IAB considers that the detail of the technical, commercial and  

 intellectual property disputes reiterated at length in the appeals  

 document is not relevant to the process matters relating to the PR-  

 action and they will not be considered further.


 As with other recent appeals on matters of posting rights, the IAB  

 conclusions apply narrowly to the process used by the IESG in  

 issuing the original PR-action and upholding their decision in  

 the appeal determination of 20 March 2006.


4. IAB Members Considering this Appeal


 This appeal was considered by the full set of voting members of the  

 IAB except for Brian Carpenter (IETF Chair) who recused himself  

 because of his previous involvement with this matter as a member of  

 the IESG.


 The remaining voting members of the IAB considered the type of  

 associations Mr. Anderson described as “conflicts of interest” for  

 the IESG. The IAB determined which members might be considered to  

 have similar associations; the rest discussed and agreed the  

 associations did not constitute material conflicts of interest in  

 this case, and the consideration of the appeal proceeded with all  

 IAB voting members except Brian Carpenter.


5. IAB Considerations


 This section addresses each of the matters listed in Section 2 in  

 turn.


5.1. Did the evidence warrant the issue of the PR-action?


 The IAB reviewed the messages cited in the PR-action as well as the  

 mailing lists in question (IETF, dnsops, etc.) and agrees with the  

 IESG that there was adequate evidence to justify the PR-action. We  

 observe that the interpretation in Mr. Anderson’s appeal of certain  

 individual messages are in many cases not the interpretation that  

 the IAB has of those same messages as they appeared in their  

 original context.


 Mr Anderson’s continued disruption of the IETF’s discussions both  

 through postings containing inflammatory and unprofessional attacks,  

 repeated re-opening of closed topics and remarks about individual  

 contributors (perceived as ad hominem attacks) fall within the  

 criteria expressed in RFC3863, and that process is therefore  

 applicable.


5.2. Was the procedure of Section 2 of RFC3683 followed adequately up  

 to when the initial PR-action was issued for Last Call?


 The IAB reviewed the specific points raised by Mr. Anderson, and the  

 available facts in the matter, and compared them to the process  

 outlined in RFC 3683. It is the determination of the IAB that the  

 process of Section 2 of RFC 3683 was followed adequately, and that  

 Mr Anderson’s specific complaints are not well grounded. Greater  

 apparent transparency might have been achieved by having somebody  

 else author the notice, but the oversight of the remaining IESG  

 members appeared to be adequate to eliminate any inappropriate  

 influence that the ‘initiator’ might have had on the outcome.


5.3. Should any members of the IESG have recused themselves who didn’t?


 Mr Anderson considers that both Brian Carpenter and David Kessens  

 have significant conflicts of interest.


 The IAB reviewed the facts and determined that the claims against  

 Brian Carpenter are unsubstantiated – his actions were clearly  

 focused on legitimate refereeing. Similarly, David Kessen’s actions  

 were aimed at appropriate warnings to Mr. Anderson; indeed, he would  

 have been failing in his responsibilities as area director for the  

 Ops area had he not done so. The IAB does not find any substance to  

 Mr. Anderson’s claims that Mr. Kessens has an association with a  

 company with which Mr. Anderson has issues. Accordingly, there is  

 no substantial reason for either of the two people named to recuse  

 themselves once it had been decided to go ahead with the process.


 Arguably the claim of conflict of interest against David Kessens as  

 introducer of the request for the PR-action could have been further  

 vitiated by having a different member of the IESG write up the  

 notice served on Mr Anderson, but the document was subject to review  

 by all IESG members who would have been made aware of the issues  

 from the messages cited. The IAB considers that the IESG was  

 entitled to delegate this work to Mr Kessens as the most efficient  

 course of action and that there was no conflict of interest.


5.4. Was the IETF Last Call Process handled correctly and the concensus  

 correctly called?


 The IESG originally announced the last call on the wrong list. Mr  

 Anderson complains that the re-issuing of the last call on the  

 correct list with an extended deadline ‘disrupted the discussion’.


 The appeal provided no evidence on the claimed discussion  

 disruption. The effect was merely an extended last call during  

 which time Mr Anderson’s posting rights were maintained. It appears  

 there were less than 10 messages on the main IETF Discussion list  

 regarding this specific Last Call (as opposed to meta-discussion of  

 the whole RFC 3683 process mainly associated with a previous  

 action). A similar number of messages were also received directly  

 by the IESG during this period.


 Subsequent to the end of the Last Call, the IESG determined that  

 there was an adequate consensus in support of the proposed PR-action  

 and they confirmed the PR-action. The IAB has reviewed both the  

 public mail archives and the mails sent directly to the IESG. The  

 IAB finds that they demonstrate that the community at large took a  

 serious interest in this issue. Opinions were expressed both for  

 and against the appropriateness of the PR-action as well as  

 expressing concerns about the usefulness of RFC 3683. After  

 considerable deliberation, the IAB believes that the IESG was  

 entitled to call the consensus in this way. The IAB has come to  

 this conclusion on a narrow interpretation: RFC 3683 has been  

 approved for use by the IETF and the IESG had been requested to  

 apply it. Discussions of the usefulness of RFC 3683 were not in  

 scope for this Last Call.


5.5. Was the evidence examined fairly and without malice?


 From all the material the IAB reviewed, it does appear that the  

 evidence was examined fairly. Mr Anderson’s appeal document  

 examines the same evidence but the IAB believes his interpretation  

 of it does not stand up to scrutiny when the whole context is  

 considered.


5.6. Did the IESG correctly act on the appeal as specified by Section  

 6.5.4 of RFC 2026?


 As regards the evidence on which the PR-action was served on Mr  

 Anderson, his appeal mostly reiterates the material that  

 precipitated the original request for a PR-action together with his  

 interpretation: there is no new evidence presented to justify an  

 appeal on evidential grounds, and some of the additional material  

 actually shows additional disruptive behavior. To that extent the  

 IESG’s refusal to indulge in re-analysis is justified.


6. IAB Conclusion on the Appeal


 The IAB found that the processes of Section 2 of RFC 3683 for the  

 original PR-action and of Section 6.5.4 of RFC 2026 for the appeal  

 had been adequately carried out, and accordingly Dean Anderson’s  

 appeal is denied.

IANA,


The IAB delegated the IPv6 address space to IANA via RFC 1881, and its format is now defined in various RFCs.


The Regional IP Registries (RIRs) are planning to start IPv6 assignments in the first quarter of 1999, to meet the requests they have received from ISPs who are planning production IPv6 service. In order to do this, the RIRs each need an initial set of Sub-TLA blocks to assign. The long term guidelines for this remain to be determined. However, in order to meet the 1Q1999 plan, an immediate initial delegation is required. We request that you make the following delegations.



```
  FP = 001
  TLA ID = 0x0001

  Sub-TLA IDs delegated as follows:

  0 0000 01XX XXXX  0x0040 - 0x007F   APNIC
  0 0000 10XX XXXX  0x0080 - 0x00BF   ARIN
  0 0000 11XX XXXX  0x00C0 - 0x00FF   RIPE-NCC

```

Regards


 Brian Carpenter, IAB Chair, for the IAB.

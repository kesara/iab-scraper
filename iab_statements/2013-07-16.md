The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) is an oversight body of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). The IAB provides oversight of the architecture for the protocols and procedures used by the Internet. Policies and management of IANA functions, including Internet numbering resources, have a broad impact on that architecture.


The IP addressing architecture is defined by the IETF. It is documented in the RFC series, most notably in RFCs 1122, 1918, 2050, 4291, 5771, and 6890. Note that RFC 2050 will soon be replaced by a document that was recently approved by the IESG. Global unicast addresses are a single (albeit large) component of the architecture. Addresses from this block are allocated to the RIRs. Several other address blocks exist, including broadcast, multicast, private address space, IPv6 anycast and special purpose address blocks. Allocation and usage of addresses in these blocks are specified in the relevant RFCs, including those listed above, and are administered in accordance with Section 4 of RFC 2860. Parts of address blocks are reserved by the IETF for future use as the Internet continues to evolve.


While the solicitation itself notes these address blocks, the draft “User Instructions” does not provide any guidance on how these blocks are used or how to obtain allocations. Rather it largely limits guidance to unicast IP address blocks. We therefore suggest either that the title of the instructions be modified to indicate that the instructions are limited to global unicast addresses, or that a section be included that discusses these other address blocks, referring to appropriate IETF documents, including, but not limited to, RFC 5226 (see below) and the relevant RFCs out of those listed above.


RFC 5226 specifies inter alia the means to establish new specialized addresses and address blocks that themselves may require different approaches to their management. The development of the above listed RFCs over the span of 25 years demonstrates that both the needs of Internet users and the capabilities of supporting organizations have evolved. It is fair, therefore, to conclude that they will continue to evolve.


The IAB looks forward to working with ICANN to further develop user instructions, and we are grateful for the opportunity to comment.

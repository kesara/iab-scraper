[![OpenSTand Badge](/wp-content/IAB-uploads/2012/08/openstand-lg.jpg)](http://open-stand.org/)On 29 August 2012, the leaders of [IAB](https://www.iab.org/), the [IEEE Standards Association](http://standards.ieee.org/), the [Internet Society](http://www.internetsociety.org/), and the [W3C](http://www.w3.org/) [signed a statement](http://open-stand.org/affirmation/) affirming the importance of a set of principles for the development of global, open standards. These principles have become known as the [“OpenStand” principles](http://open-stand.org/principles/). A year later, in the face allegations of interference by some governments in the standards development process, now is an opportune time to review the strengths of the modern paradigm captured in the OpenStand principles. Developing standards in accordance with the OpenStand principles offers the best known defense against interference by any actor.


The Internet depends upon standards developed in an open and transparent manner which facilitates wide review. Openness allows any interested party to participate, review, critique, or question the work of others. Transparency provides visibility into all steps of the process and provides appropriate audit trails for inspection. Broad consensus, after review from a wide range of interests and perspectives, fosters agreement on the resulting standards.


While the OpenStand principles cannot ensure that all participants are acting in good faith, following the principles is the best way we know to decrease the risk that any participant can inappropriately manipulate the standards development process. We believe organizations that operate according to the OpenStand principles create the most robust basis for a trustworthy standards in all fields of technology, including security and privacy.

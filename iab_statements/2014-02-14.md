Leaders of the organizations responsible for coordination of the Internet technical infrastructure (loosely referred to as “I\* leaders”) met last week in Santa Monica, California, USA. During the 2-day meeting, they discussed activities underway and exchanged views and updates on a range of topics including:


* IETF and W3C efforts to improve overall Internet privacy and security (<http://www.ietf.org> & <http://w3.org>)
* Globalization of the IANA functions (<http://www.iana.org>)
* The 1net initiative, website and new collaboration forum (<http://1net.org>)
* The “Netmundial” – Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance (<http://netmundial.br>)

* Preparations for the 2014 ITU Plenipotentiary Conference (<http://www.internetsociety.org/plenipotbackground>)
* Web 25th anniversary and W3C 20th anniversary planning (<http://w3.org>)


There was discussion of the significant progress and momentum that has developed since our last meeting, and as well as the need for continued engagement of all stakeholders in evolution of the Internet ecosystem. The leaders were encouraged by the progress made in many areas, and note that there is a lot of work happening in our respective communities, driven by the participants and handled with the usual community processes.


The meeting also welcomed Kathy Brown, the incoming CEO of the Internet Society, and Carolina Aguerre as a representative of the ccTLD registry community.

```

Referring to previous discussions regarding the allocation of an IPv6 unicast prefix for use as “Teredo service prefix” as specified in the “IANA considerations” section of [draft-huitema-v6ops-teredo-05.txt](http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-huitema-v6ops-teredo-05.txt), currently in the RFC Editor queue for publication as Experimental RFC, the IAB requests that IANA allocate a prefix.


Specifically, the IAB requests that IANA use the process outlined in [draft-huston-ipv6-iana-specials-00.txt](http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-huston-ipv6-iana-specials-00.txt), which has been submitted to the IESG for publication.


Leslie,  

for the IAB.

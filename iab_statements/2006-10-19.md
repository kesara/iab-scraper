From: Leslie Daigle To: Jim Jones – OIF Technical Committee Chair Subj: IETF Protocol Extensions Cc: iab@ietf.org To: Jim Jones OIF Technical Committee Chair Mr. Jones, We have followed the information exchanged between the OIF and the CCAMP working group on the use, extension and changes of IETF protocols for the OSPF ENNI and the OIF UNI. We would like to take this opportunity to make sure you are aware that the only legitimate way to change or extend an IETF protocol is within the processes specified by the IETF. Currently there are two documents under development describing these processes; on a more general level – <http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-carpenter-protocol-extensions>


and for mpls and gmpls protocols in particular – <http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-andersson-rtg-gmpls-change>


Best regards, Leslie Daigle, Chair, IAB.

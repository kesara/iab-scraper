Historically, the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) has provided a
liaison to the Root Server System Advisory Committee (RSSAC). With the
recent reestablishment of the RSSAC, this statement confirms this
on-going liaison.

This liaison is nominated by IAB using its own procedures, as
described in RFC2850. The IAB-appointed liaison sits on the RSSAC
committee as a non-voting member and follows RSSAC procedures. The
liaison acts a conduit between the two organisations on matters that
need to be coordinated or communicated between the two organisations.

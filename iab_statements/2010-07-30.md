Rod Beckstrom,
Dear Rod,

The IAB requests that the generation and administration of
in-addr.arpa be performed by ICANN as a technical work item per the
existing ICANN/IETF MOU (RFC2860), and further described in
"Management Guidelines & Operational Requirements for the Address and
Routing Parameter Area Domain ("arpa")", BCP 52 (RFC 3172).

ARIN is the agent of the Number Resource Organization (NRO) for
performing this task today, and has agreed to transition this task to
ICANN as described in the previous paragraph.  As the operator of
this registry function we respectfully request that ICANN work with
ARIN to facilitate this transition, and that the community be kept
aware of the transition, particularly as it relates to any operational
considerations that may arise.

Please do not hesitate to contact myself or John Curran at ARIN if
there are any questions.

For the IAB,

- --Olaf Kolkman
 IAB Chair

Paul,


The IAB has noted that the recent settlement with VeriSign, specfically the agreement to transition the root server management[[1](#1)], describes some planned actions with respect to the .ARPA domain. As you know (BCP52[[2](#2)]), the IAB has joint management responsibilities with ICANN for the .ARPA domain. We therefore agree with the input ICANN has received[[3](#3)] that the settlement agreement is remiss in failing to provide the IAB an opportunity to review the planned changes in .ARPA management.


In the planned update of the settlement agreement, we would therefore expect to see provision for the IAB to review the proposed changes before they are executed.


For this, and any proposed future changes to .ARPA, we would ask that you send a note to the IAB Chair. The IABâ€™s responses and any requests for changes to .ARPA management data (e.g., WHOIS entries) are to be considered authoritative from the IAB when so indicated and sent by the IAB Chair.


Best regards,


Leslie,  

IAB Chair.

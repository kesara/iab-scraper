IAB Review of Structure of the IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------



Wed, 16 Feb 2005



The IAB has reviewed [draft-ietf-iasa-bcp-06](http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-iasa-bcp-06.txt) and supports the document going forward as the next step in the IETFâ€™s administrative restructuring process. The IAB is ready to undertake the roles and responsibilities assigned to it by the document.


As part of the public discussion of this document, people have asked for various types of reviews of the document from the IAB. In making the statement above, the IAB is explicitly expressing its commitment to support the structure once the document is approved. While individual IAB members have contributed as participants in the community discussion, the IAB as a body is explicitly not attempting to gauge or express an opinion on the consensus of the community. The IAB has discussed whether it should undertake to do so for this particular document, and noting the role of the IAB as a point of appeal of IESG actions, its members were agreed that the task of assessing community consensus as input to an IESG decision remains outside the role of the IAB.


Leslie Daigle,  

for the IAB.

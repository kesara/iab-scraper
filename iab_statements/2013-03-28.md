On 28 March 2013, the IAB sent the following response to the [RSSAC](https://www.icann.org/en/groups/rssac "RSSAC") in response to their proposed restructure document:



```
Per RFC2850, the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) sees its liaison
role to RSSAC to be essential and strategic for the Internet
Architecture.  The IETF has a key role in discussing the technical 
requirements of the DNS root servers together with the root server 
operators, ICANN and the various stakeholders. The IAB welcomes 
the restructuring of the RSSAC. 

Our reading of the planned restructuring leads us to believe that the
Executive circle will be the active decision-making body in the RSSAC.
In order to be an effective link between the bodies, the IAB liaison
will need to communicate directly with the decision authority in the
RSSAC. Therefore, the IAB requests that the IAB (non-voting) liaison 
be placed within the Executive circle as described in the current 
RSSAC document.
```

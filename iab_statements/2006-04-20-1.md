Richard,


I trust this note finds you well!


By way of “FYI”, the IAB is updating its contact information in WHOIS entries, including e164.arpa. I note particularly that this is not a substantive change, but merely a change of address as the IETF (and hence the IAB) have changed support organization structures recently.


Best regards,


Leslie.

Hello,


With this, I would like to signal a “change of address” for the IAB and request an update to the WHOIS information for the e164.arpa zone.


Namely, the registrant and administrative contact information should now read:



```

Name: Organization: Internet Architecture Board (IAB) 
  c/o IETF Administrative Support Activity, ISOC 
Address1: 1775 Wiehle Ave.

Postal Code: 20190-5108 
Phone: +1 703 326 9880 
Fax: +1 703 326 9881 
Email: iab@iab.org

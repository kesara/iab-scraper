Under its responsibilities documented in RFC 2850 the IAB will, from time to time, appoint people to represent the IETF or IAB to other organizations as liaisons. The procedures for how liaison relations are handled are currently documented in RFCs [4052](http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4052.txt "RFC 4052"), [4053](http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4053.txt "RFC 4053"), and [4691](http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4691.txt "RFC 4691"). In addition, the IAB responsibilities include appointments to various other bodies, such as ISOC Board Trustees and ICANN board liaisons, as well as committee members for the ICANN TLG and ICANN NomCom.


While the roles differ, the IAB generally believes that the guiding principle should be that individuals serve without expectation of direct compensation from the bodies to which they are appointed, so as to avoid any appearance of conflict of interest. As a result, apart from reasonable travel expenses, the IAB generally requests that its appointees decline offers of compensation from the bodies to which they are appointed. The IAB will consider exceptions on a case-by-case basis.

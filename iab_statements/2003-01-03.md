Dear Stuart,


The IETF notes that the Board of ICANN has adopted the transition instruments relating to the reform of ICANN’s structure and its supporting organizations.


The IETF is a signatory to the Protocol Support Organization Memorandum of Understanding, and it is noted that this organization is no longer a recognized support organization of ICANN following the Board’s adoption of the transition instruments related to the evolution and reform of ICANN.


This message is to give formal notice to ICANN, and to the other signatories of the Protocol Support Organization Memorandum of Understanding, that the IETF hereby withdraws from the Protocol Support Organization.


The IETF looks forward to working with ICANN within the revised ICANN structures.


Regards,


Harald Alvestrand  

Chair, IETF

John,




Thank you for passing on the recommendation from the ICANN Security and Stability Advisory Committee, namely that:




> 
>  ICANN should recommend that the IAB consider issuing an informational RFC advising of the issue, and publicising this through the IETF technical community.
>

The issue relates to the deployment of applications that include some form of checking the syntax of names, where the check appears to be inappropriately implemented.




The IAB has considered this recommendation, and notes that the  

[Informational RFC 3696, “Application Techniques for Checking and Transformation of Names](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3696.txt)“, published in February 2004, includes a very complete examination of this matter. Indeed it is unclear that any IAB note would deviate from this document in any substantive way.




Accordingly, the IAB does not feel that the preparation of a separate informational document on the topic is merited in this case.




Leslie,  

For the IAB.

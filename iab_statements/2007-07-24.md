Subject: Deployment of DNSSEC in the e164.arpa zone
```

Dear Malcolm Johnson,


We have recently received [a note from the RIPE NCC](https://www.iab.org/documents/correspondence/2007-07-05-ripe-ncc-dnssec-e164.html) in which they made us aware of their plans to start deployment of DNSSEC on e164.arpa shortly. The IAB has reviewed the RIPE NCC plan and endorses this improvement to the operation of the e164.arpa domain.


As part of our commitment to coordinate with ITU-T TSB in the case of material changes in the operation of e164.arpa, we are bringing this planned change to your attention. This is a material change in the operation of e164.arpa in the sense that it allows the operation of the e164.arpa domain to progress along the lines outlined in latest version of the security considerations of the defining standard.


We are happy to receive or relay any comments you may have on this issue. We intend to ask RIPE NCC to begin the implementation of this plan in 4 weeks (August 24, 2007).


On behalf of the IAB,  

kind regards,


Olaf Kolkman, IAB Chair.

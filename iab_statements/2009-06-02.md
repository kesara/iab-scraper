Dear Barbara,


With reference to an earlier communication to IANA about signing .ARPA [1] and with reference to our shared responsibility as acknowledged in RFC 3172 we would like to reiterate our request for IANA to sign .ARPA.


More specifically we would like to receive a plan for the deployment of DNSSEC within a few months, preferably deployment before the Stockholm IETF.


In the interest of transparency we would like to receive a plan detailing the technical details for IAB and community review.


Kind regards, for the IAB,


â€“Olaf Kolkman,  

 IAB Chair.

The IAB supports the analysis provided by the Internet Society in November 2021 in their [Internet impact Brief on Mandated Browser Root Certificates in the European Unionâ€™s eIDAS Regulation on the Internet](https://www.internetsociety.org/resources/doc/2021/internet-impact-brief-mandated-browser-root-certificates-in-the-eu-eidas-regulation/). The analysis depicts that enforcing a regulatory requirement to mandate the use and support of specific Internet infrastructure, especially without establishing rules for operation and control, endangers Internet security and creates a precedent of governmental control that has the potential for misuse.


While the IAB does not intend to provide an additional analysis beyond the one provided by ISOC, individual members have co-signed [a letter](https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/documents/Re__Concerns_the_Revised_Article_45_of_e-ID_Draft_Legislative_Proposal_xbnJTci.pdf) with Vint Cerf to support directions and recommendations by ISOC and various other organizations that came to similar conclusions in their analysis.

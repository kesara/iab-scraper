Real requests (and therefore delegations from e164.arpa) can only be on E.164 country codes. i.e. +1, +7 etc.


This will not stop people from requesting +74, +1208 etc.


A request for +1208 (as one example) should be filed as +1208 on  

<http://www.ripe.net/enum/request-archives/>, which will say ‘reject’, as it is not a country code.


If the administrator for +1 (North American Numbering Plan) wishes to delegate +1208 from RIPE NCC as administrator, then first +1 delegation has to be approved. Whether that is to be delegated to RIPE NCC or some other entity is up to the administrator of +1.


So, RIPE NCC can, if they are duly delegated, host the DNS zone for 1.e164.arpa, but whether RIPE NCC want to take on that job (or not) is a decision RIPE NCC has to make, in consultation with the NANP administration.

The formal e164.arpa zone delegation, from an IAB perspective, is from e164.arpa to 1.e164.arpa.

As part its role in supporting the RFC Editor function, the Internet  

Architecture Board (IAB) has created a public mailing list for the  

discussion of the RFC Independent Submissions process.


The purpose of this discussion is to achieve consensus, in the coming  

weeks, on a process for fair and appropriate approval of independent  

submissions to the RFC series. These are separate from IETF, IAB or  

IRTF approved submissions.


Individuals familiar with the RFC series and working in the Internet  

research and engineering community are invited to join this mailing list  

and participate. independent@ietf.org  

<https://www1.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/independent>


There is an initial draft proposal, available at

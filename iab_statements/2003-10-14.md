### 1. Introduction



> 
> This document contains a summary of the security survey sent out by the IAB in June, 2003. The goal of the survey was to obtain information about what kinds of security work were being done in IETF Working Groups, in order to find any commonalities between work at different layers. The survey took the form of an email sent to the wgchairs@ietf.org mailing list containing a series of questions about security work in different Working Groups.

> The ZEROCONF Working Group chair provided the following general information about use of security in the protocol:

> 
> 
> SRVLOC is currently officially dormant and does not meet at IETF meetings, though there is active discussion on the mailing list. The last Working Group chair before the group went dormant provided the following general information about use of security in the protocol: 
> 
> 
> SLP allows applications to generate ‘service urls‘ which identify services. Each service URL is also coupled with a ‘service type’ string, a list of attributes and also optionally a SLP ‘security parameter index’ string. Authentication is done over the parameters listed above by matching a public/private key pair to the security parameter index string. The producer of the service information signs, the consumer of the service information verifies the signatures before accepting the service information. This can only be done if the signer and verifier have the needed keys and/or certificates or can get them. SLP does not provide for key or certificate distribution or discovery.

In some specialized URIs, even L2 addresses can be provided. In some cases a unique ID is used to identify services as well) |

> > | **Provisioning/Configuration of security information** | By unspecified out of band mechanism (Does not provision security information. It assumes that keys and key names (SLP security parameter index strings) are configured in SLP agents). |

> #### 2.4 BRIDGE
> 
> 
> The BRIDGE Working Group is defining are MIBs, and the chair reported that the survey was not applicable, since BRIDGE relies on the security of SNMP for user authentication, encryption and other protection. The MIBs do not contain any security information.

> > | **Identification of remote endpoints by** | DNS, IP, and other mechanisms used in MIBs, other mechanisms are possible under script control. |
> > | **Identification of data in a hierarchy by** | Don’t understand what you mean by SNMP here. My answer would have to be OID, but all of the above are possible in scripting environments supported by disman. |
> > | **Authentication of users or administrators** | Authentication handled under SNMPv3, by whatever security model is being used. |
> > | **Authentication of remote endpoints** | SNMPv3 USM security is user, rather than endpoint based. If someone were crazy enough to design an endpoint-based security model (and hook it into VACM), the disman MIBs would still work. |
> > | **Protecting data** | SNMPv3 for transfer. Storage is out of scope. |
> > | **Provisioning/Configuration of security information** | SNMPv3, using whatever security model, e.g., USM.  |

> 
> 
> One of the Working Group chairs provided the following general comment on EAP applicability: 
> 
> 
> 
> > 
> > The "EAP Appropriate Use" policy formulated by Jeff Schiller at IETF 47 was that EAP is a mechanism created for use in situations where IP is not available (e.g. link layer authentication). It MUST NOT be used over the Internet without protection. 
> > 
> > 
> > That policy is still in effect, and all RFCs relating to EAP conform to it so far. SASL is not much different for simple mechanisms, but is considerably better for complex ones since it runs over TCP and therefore can much more efficiently handle things like certificate exchanges. However, it has no way of handling man-in-the-middle attacks.

> > | **Identification of remote endpoints by** | Text string, other. Being an old protocol for network access security, EAP does not have a very good representation of the network’s identity. However, a text string can be passed. ALso, in most cases this identification happens at a lower layer, e.g. WLAN

> > | **Authentication of users or administrators** | Passwords, cryptographic algorithms. Some of the EAP methods are password based. None of them are cleartext password-based.. All EAP methods are based on some sort of a cryptographic algorithm. Simple password algorithm, a more advanced shared secret algorithm, something stolen from TLS & cert world, etc. are some examples. |

> > | **Protecting data** | SSL and/or TLS (EAP TLS), IPsec ( Not typically, though EAP may be encapsulated in RADIUS/DIAMETER and protected by IPsec, or it may be used by IKEv2. But EAP as such does not make use of IPsec nor IKE), other specs (The question is unclear for EAP. Surely the use of TLS/XML etc. would also be a reference to other specs.

### 3. Conclusions



> 
> This survey did not elicit the information that we were looking for, though it did give us some ideas about how a future survey could be better organized. By incorrectly anticipating the kinds of information we expected to get, we made it difficult for some respondents to make sense of the questions (and probably discouraged others from responding at all). 
> 
> 
> We should have had an explanation of what we were looking for and why, and an easy way for a respondent to say "there’s nothing going on in this working group that you would care about". Only after passing that hurdle should we have had more detailed questions. 
> 
> 
> More importantly, we should have worked with the Security ADs  
> 
>  to take advantage of their knowledge of what’s going on and hence how to phrase questions. Whether such a survey would be worthwhile should be discussed. We were trying to identify places where people were reinventing the wheel in the security space rather than leveraging the work of security working groups or where new security working groups might be useful to coordinate the efforts in this space. The survey was prompted by concerns expressed that this might be widespread. While the response we got was spotty, we did not find evidence to support the concern. It’s possible that this effort should either be abandoned or done under the auspices of some other group like the Security ADs or the Security Directorate.

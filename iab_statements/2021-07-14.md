The IESG issued a Statement on Inclusive Language on 11 May, 2021. [IESG]


The IAB concurs with that statement. Clear, precise, and widely accessible language is equally valuable in contributions to the IAB stream. Therefore, the IAB will follow the guidance in [NISTIR8366] for all IAB stream documents and RFCs, and encourages all contributors to do the same.


The IAB further notes that the RFC style guide [RFC-STYLE], which IAB-stream RFCs should follow, makes a similar recommendation.

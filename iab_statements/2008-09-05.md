### Introduction


 The IAB, on behalf of the Internet technical community, is concerned with ensuring the continuity of the RFC Series, orderly RFC Editor succession, maintaining RFC quality, and RFC document accessibility. The IAB is also sensitive to the concerns of the IAOC about providing the necessary services in a cost effective and efficient manner.


 The definition of the RFC series is described in RFC 4844.  
Section 3.1 defines “RFC Editor”:



3.1. RFC Editor  
  
  

Originally, there was a single person acting as editor of the RFC  
  

Series (the RFC Editor).  The task has grown, and the work now  
requires the organized activity of several experts, so there are RFC  
Editors, or an RFC Editor organization.  In time, there may be  
multiple organizations working together to undertake the work  
required by the RFC Series.  For simplicity’s sake, and without  
attempting to predict how the role might be subdivided among them,  
this document refers to this collection of experts and organizations  
as the “RFC Editor”.  
  
The RFC Editor is an expert technical editor and series editor,  
acting to support the mission of the RFC Series.  As such, the RFC  
Editor is the implementer handling the editorial management of the  
RFC Series, in accordance with the defined processes.  In addition,  
the RFC Editor is expected to be the expert and prime mover in  
discussions about policies for editing, publishing, and archiving  
RFCs.

 RFC 4844 envisions changes in the RFC Editor organizational structure. The IAB considered a change to increase flexibility and operational support options, provide for the orderly succession of the RFC Editor, and ensure the continuity of the RFC series, while maintaining RFC quality, maintaining timely processing, ensuring document accessibility, reducing costs, and increasing cost transparency.


#### Expenses for the RFC Editor


The expenses discussed in this document are not new expenses.  They are part of the IASA budget.  Today, these expenses are part of the RFC Editor contract with ISI.


#### IAOC Implementation


The model is constructed in such a way that it allows for all these functions to be implemented jointly or under different contracts. In fact, a bidder could put together a proposal that includes one or more subcontractors. Since the reporting structure would depend on how the manner that the contracts are awarded, they are subject to change over time. As a result, the model does only describe responsibilities, procedures, and process. The exact implementation is a responsibility of the IAOC.


### Proposed RFC Editor Model


 The proposed RFC Editor model divides the responsibilities for the RFC Series into the following:


1. RFC Editor
2. Independent Submission Editor
3. RFC Production
4. RFC Publisher


The RFC Series Production and Process under this structure is schematically represented by the figure below.


![RFC-EDITOR Production and Process](/documents/resources/RFCEditorProd.png)


#### RFC Editor


The RFC Editor is a single person, and this person is responsible for:


1. Identifying appropriate steps for RFC Series continuity
2. Participate in IAOC reviews of the RFC Publisher and RFC Publication  
 functions to ensure the above mentioned continuity
3. RFC Style Manual publication for use by authors, editors, and the RFC publisher
4. RFC errata process management
5. Liaison with the IAB


After identifying the appropriate steps for RFC continuity, the implementation of those steps lay with the RFC production and publishing functions. Since it is the IAOC that maintains oversight of the implementation, RFC Editor participation in reviews of that implementation is expected.


The RFC Editor is a senior managerial position with a strong understanding of the IETF process and seasoned management skills, and is supported by the RFC Editorial board (see below).


The IAOC has two alternative selection methods it may consider in an RFI and subsequent RFP.


The first alternative for the selection of the RFC Editor is through a Request for Proposal (RFP) process run by the IAOC. The IAOC would seek a person with the listed qualifications in a broadly distributed RFP. The winner would be selected by the IAOC in consultation with the IAB, and then, the IAOC would contract for the services. Contract terms, including length of contract, extensions and renewals, shall be as defined in an RFP. The opportunity to bid shall be broadly available. Expenses to support the administrative operation of the RFC Editor would be part of the awarded contract and be part of the IASA budget.


The second alternative is an individual with the listed qualifications selected by the community and confirmed by the IAB. An approach similar to the one used by the IAB to select an IAOC member every other year as described in RFC 4333 could be used. Expenses to support the administrative operation of the RFC Editor selected in this manner would be part of the IASA budget.



#### Independent Submission Editor


 The Independent Submission Editor is a single person, and this person is  
responsible for:


1. Independent Submissions approval and processing
2. Forwarding RFCs in the independent stream to the RFC Production
3. Independent Submissions RFC errata review and approval
4. Appointment of RFC Editorial Board members, see below


The Independent Submission Editor is a senior position for which the  
following qualifications are desired:


1. Technical competence
2. Deep familiarity with the RFC series
3. An ability to assess the technical competence of potential Editorial Board members
4. Good standing in the technical community in and beyond the IETF



 The individual with the listed qualifications would be selected by the community and confirmed by the IAB. An approach similar to the one used by the IAB to select an IAOC member every other year as described in RFC 4333 could be used. Expenses to support the administrative operation of the Independent Submission Editor selected in this manner would be part of the IASA budget.


#### RFC Production


In the proposed split of activities, RFC Production is performed by a paid contractor, and the contractor responsibilities include:


1. Editing inputs from all RFC streams to comply with the RFC Style Manual
2. Creating records of edits performed on documents
3. Engaging in dialogue with authors when clarification is needed
4. Creating records of dialogue with documents authors
5. Requesting advice from the RFC Editor as needed
6. Provide suggestions to the RFC Editor as needed
7. Coordinating with IANA to obtain registry information
8. RFC number assignment
9. Forwarding ready-to-publish documents to the RFC Publisher
10. Forwarding records of edits and author dialogue to RFC Publisher
11. Liaison with IESG and IAB



The RFC Production contractor is to be selected by the IAOC through an RFP process, possibly as part of the same contract as the RFC Editor. The IAOC would seek a bidder who, among other things, is able to provide a timely and cost effective service against the established style and production guidelines. Contract terms, including length of contract, extensions and renewals, shall be as defined in an RFP. The opportunity to bid shall be broadly available.


#### RFC Publisher


In the proposed model, the RFC Publisher responsibilities include:


1. Announce and provide online access to RFCs
2. Provide online system to submit RFC Errata
3. Provide online access to approved RFC Errata
4. Provide backups
5. Provide storage and preservation of records
6. Authenticate RFCs for legal proceedings



Implementation of the RFC publisher function can be pursued in two different ways. The first alternative is to extend the IETF Secretariat contract to include these services. Expenses to support these services would be part of the revised contract. The second alternative is a separate vendor selected by the IAOC through an RFP process. Expenses to support service would be part of the awarded contract.



#### The RFC Editorial Board


Today the RFC Editor is supported by an Editorial Board. This Board will continue as it stands, to support the Independent Submissions Editor’s review work and provide input and guidance to the RFC Editor. The appointment of board members will be the responsibility of the Independent Submission Editor. The Independent Submission Editor will work with the RFC Editor.

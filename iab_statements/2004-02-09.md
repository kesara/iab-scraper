Subject: Delegation of 2.0.0.2.ip6.arpa

```


The IAB has considered the most appropriate form of delegation of the reverse mapping for IPv6 addresses used by the 6to4 scheme (as described in [RFC3056](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3056.txt)).


The IAB has determined that the zone **2.0.0.2.ip6.arpa** be delegated to the Regional Internet Registries. ([Minutes of IAB meeting, 17 July 2003](/documents/iabmins/iabmins.2003-07-17.html))


It is [noted](2004-01-19-nro.html) that the Regional Internet Registries have recently created the  

[Number Regional Organization](http://www.nro.org) ([NRO](http://www.nro.org)), an organization intended to support joint RIR activities including this function of common management of this reverse zone.


Could you please coordinate this delegation with the secretariat of the NRO, a function currently being operated by APNIC. Paul Wilson, the Director General of APNIC is copied on this note for this reason.



kind regards,




 Geoff Huston  

 Executive Director  

 Internet Architecture Board

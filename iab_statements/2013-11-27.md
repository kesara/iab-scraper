At the Vancouver IETF meeting, the IAB held a technical plenary that discussed pervasive monitoring.  The IAB believes that pervasive monitoring represents an attack on the Internet in as much as large amounts of information that is intended to be confidential between sets of individuals is in fact gathered and aggregated by third parties. Such a broad scale attack can undermine confidence in the infrastructure, no matter the intent of those collecting the information.


draft-farrell-perpass-attack-00 is intended to establish an IETF community consensus on this matter.  We encourage the community to read and engage in discussion about this draft, and also to take practical measures to limit pervasive monitoring within their environments.


On behalf of the IAB,

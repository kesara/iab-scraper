Subject: UPDATE to contact information for e164.arpa

```

Hello,


With this, I would like to signal a “change of address” for the IAB and request an update to the WHOIS information for the e164.arpa zone.


Namely, the registrant and administrative contact information should now read:



```

Phone: +1 703 326 9880 
Fax: +1 703 326 9881

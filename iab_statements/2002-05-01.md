### IETF and ITU-T Cooperation Arrangements


**May 2002** 


 


In support of the IETF/ITU-T cooperation process defined in RFC2436 and its subsequent updates, the IETF waives the meeting fee for each ITU-T Study Group Chairman, or that person’s designated representative, when attending IETF meetings. This is due to the reciprocal membership agreement between ITU and ISOC.

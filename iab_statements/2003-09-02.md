IAB Advisory Committee on IETF Administration Relationships
-----------------------------------------------------------



The purpose of the committee is to review the existing IETF administration relationships (RFC-Editor, IETF Secretariat, etc) and propose IETF management process or structural changes that would improve the overall functioning of the IETF. Any such proposal will be subject to review and acceptance by the IAB and IETF plenary. Note that the scope of the advisory committee does NOT include proposed changes to the standards development processes (e.g., WG organization, IESG management of documents or working groups, etc).




The committee is chaired by the IAB Chair, Leslie Daigle, and consists of:


* Bernard Aboba
* Harald Alvestrand (IETF Chair)
* Lynn St.Amour (ISOC President)
* Fred Baker (Chair, ISOC Board of Trustees)
* Brian Carpenter
* Steve Crocker
* Leslie Daigle (IAB Chair, chair of the committee)
* John Klensin



Additional input is welcome. The committee will also make a particular effort to seek out further input as needed.

Subject: UPDATE to administrative contact information for .arpa

```

Hello,


With this, I would like to signal a “change of address” for the IAB and request an update to the WHOIS administrative contact information for the .arpa TLD.


Namely, the administrative contact information should now read:



```
[.arpa] Administrative Contact: 
Name: Organization: Internet Architecture Board (IAB) c/o IETF 
Administrative Support Activity, ISOC 
Address1: 1775 Wiehle Ave. 
Address2: Suite 102 
Address3: 
City: Reston 
State/Province: Virginia 
Country: US P
ostal Code: 20190-5108 
Phone: +1 703 326 9880 
Fax: +1 703 326 9881 
Email: iab@iab.org

```

Thanks, and best regards,


Leslie Daigle,  

Chair, IAB.

*1 September 2016*


The IAB has reviewed the IANA Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Assignment Agreement, the IANA IPR License Agreement and the IANA IPR Community Agreement, as published for comment at <<https://www.ianacg.org/call-for-public-comment-on-iana-ipr-agreements/>>. We believe that these meet the expectations of the IETF community as expressed in RFC 7979 (“Response to the IANA Stewardship Transition Coordination Group (ICG) Request for Proposals on the IANA Protocol Parameters Registries”, available at <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7979.txt>), and as reflected in the ICG’s Transition Proposal (<https://www.ianacg.org/icg-files/documents/IANA-transition-proposal-final.pdf>).


The IAB notes that these agreements are presently posted for public comments through September 12, 2016 at 23:59 UTC.  Presuming a favorable review of the comments received, the IAB anticipates that IETF community representatives will sign these agreements in order to facilitate the IANA Stewardship transition.


On Behalf of the IAB,


Andrew Sullivan  

IAB Chair
